<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>All configurable data is placed in config.inc.php3.</p>
<p><b>$cfgServers</b> array<br>
  Since version 1.4.2, phpMyAdmin supports the adminstration of multiple MySQL-server. 
  Therefore, a $cfgServers-array has been added which contains the login information 
  for the different servers. $cfgServers[1]['host'] contains the hostname of the 
  first server, $cfgServers[2]['host'] the hostname of the second server, etc. 
  If you have only one server to administer, simply leave free the hostname of 
  the other $cfgServer-entries. 
<p><b>$cfgServers[n]['host']</b> string<br>
  The hostname of your n-th MySQL-server. E.g. localhost.</p>
<p><b>$cfgServers[n]['port']</b> string<br>
  The port-number of your n-th MySQL-server. Default is 3300 (leave blank).</p>
<p><b>$cfgServers[n]['adv_auth']</b> boolean<br>
  Whether basic or advanced authentication should be used for this server. Basic 
  authentication ($adv_auth = false) is the plain old way: username and password 
  are stored in config.inc.php3. Advanced authentication $adv_auth = true) as 
  introduced in 1.3.0 allows you to log in as any valid MySQL user via HTTP-Auth. 
  All you have to provide in config.inc is a standard user which can connect to 
  MySQL and read the mysql user/db table (see $cfgServers[n]['stduser']).<br>
  Using advanced authentication is recommended:</p>
<ul>
  <li> when phpMyAdmin is running in a multi-user environment where people have 
    shell-access that you don't want to know the username/password for MySQL.</li>
  <li>when you want to give users access to their own database and don't want 
    them to play around with others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advanced authentication is secure as the standard user needs just read-only-access 
  to the mysql database. MySQL passwords cannot be decrypted easily, so there's 
  no chance for a normal user to look at other users' plaintext passwords.</p>
<p><b>$cfgServers[n]['stduser'] </b>string<br>
  <b>$cfgServers[n]['stdpass']</b> string<br>
  A user/pasword pair used to verify the real user/password pair when using advanced 
  authentification. This user must be able to connect to MySQL and read the mysql 
  user table. Not needed when using basic authentification.</p>
<p><b>$cfgServers[n]['user']</b> string<br>
  <b>$cfgServers[n]['password']</b> string<br>
  The user/password-pair which phpMyAdmin will use to connect to this MySQL-server 
  when using basic authentification. Not needed when using advanced authentification.</p>
<p><b>$cfgServers[n]['only_db']</b> string<br>
  If set to a database name, only this database will be shown to the user.</p>
<p><b>$cfgServers[n]['verbose']</b> string<br>
  Only useful when using phpMyAdmin with multiple server entries. If set, this 
  string will be displayed instead of the hostname in the pulldown menu on the 
  main page. This can be useful if you want to show only certain databases on 
  your system, for example.<br>
</p>
<p><b>$cfgServers[n]['bookmarkdb']</b> string<br>
  <b>$cfgServers[n]['bookmarktable']</b> string<br>
  Since release 2.3.0 phpMyAdmin allows to bookmark queries. This can be useful for queries
  you often run. To use this functionality you have to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>create a table following this scheme:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CREATE TABLE bookmark (<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;id int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL auto_increment,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dbase varchar(255) NOT NULL,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label varchar(255) NOT NULL,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;query text NOT NULL,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRIMARY KEY (id)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;);<br></li>
  <li>then complete the two variables $cfgServers[n]['bookmarkdb'] and
  $cfgServers[n]['bookmarktable'] so phpMyAdmin will be able to find the bookmark table.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>$cfgServerDefault</b> integer<br>
  If you have more than one server configured, you can set $cfgServerDefault to any one of
  them to autoconnect to that server when phpMyAdmin is started, or set it to 0 to be given
  a list of servers without logging in.
  If you have only one server configured, $cfgServerDefault MUST be set to that server.
</p>

<p><b>$cfgManualBase</b> string<br>
  If set to an URL which points to the MySQL documentation, appropriate help links 
are generated.<br>
</p>
<p><b>$cfgConfirm </b>boolean<br>
  Whether a warning (&quot;Are your really sure..&quot;) should be displayed when 
  you're about to loose data.</p>
<p><b>$cfgPersistentConnections </b>boolean<br>
  Whether persistent connections should be used or not (mysql_connect or mysql_pconnect).</p>
<p><b>$cfgBorder </b>integer<br>
  The size of a table's border.</p>
<p><b>$cfgThBgcolor </b>string [HTML color]<br>
  The color (HTML) used for table headers.</p>
<p><b>$cfgBgcolorOne </b>string [HTML color]<br>
  The color (HTML) #1 for table rows.</p>
<p><b>$cfgBgcolorTwo </b>string [HTML color]<br>
  The color (HTML) #2 for table rows.</p>
<p><b>$cfgMaxRows </b>integer<br>
  Number of rows displayed when browsing a resultset. If the resultset contains 
  more rows, Previous/Next links will be shown.</p>
<p><b>$cfgMaxInputsize </b>integer<br>
  Size of the edit-field when adding a new record to a table.</p>
<p><b>$cfgOrder </b>string ["DESC"|"ASC"]<br>
  Defines whether fields are displayed in ascending ("ASC") order or in descending 
  ("DESC") order when you click on the field-name. 
<p><b>$cfgShowBlob </b>boolean<br>
  Defines whether BLOB fields are shown when browsing a table's content or not.
<p><b>$cfgShowSQL </b>boolean<br>
  Defines whether sql-queries generated by phpMyAdmin should be displayed or not.
<p><b>$cfgModifyDeleteAtLeft </b>boolean<br>
  <b>$cfgModifyDeleteAtRight </b>boolean<br>
  Defines the place where modify and delete links would be put when tables contents are
  displayed (you may have them displayed both at the left and at the right).<br>
</p>

<p><b>$cfgDefaultLang </b>string<br>
  Defines the default language to use, if not browser-defined or user-defined.<br>
  See the <i>select_lang.inc.php3</i> script to know the valid values for this setting.</p>
<p><b>$cfgLang </b>string<br>
  Force: always use this language (must be defined in the <i>select_lang.inc.php3</i> script).<br>
</p>

<p><b>$cfgColumnTypes </b>array<br>
  All possible types of a MySQL column. In most cases you don't need to edit this.</p>
<p><b>$cfgFunctions </b>array<br>
  A list of functions MySQL supports. In most cases you don't need to edit this.</p>
<p><b>$cfgAttributeTypes </b>array<br>
  Possible attributes for fields. In most cases you don't need to edit this.</p>

<h2>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><b>I can't insert new rows into a table - MySQL brings up a SQL-error.<br>
  </b>
Examine the SQL error with care. I've found that many programmers specifying a wrong field-type. Common errors include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using VARCHAR without a size argument 
  <li>Using TEXT or BLOB with a size argument </li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, look at the syntax chapter in the MySQL manual to confirm that your syntax is correct.</p>
<p><b>phpMyAdmin can't connect to MySQL. What's wrong?<br>
  </b>
Either there is an error with your PHP setup or your username/password is 
  wrong. Try to make a small script which uses mysql_connect and see if it works. 
  If it doesn't, it may be you haven't even compiled MySQL support into PHP.</p>
<p><b>I cannot edit the content of a table, even if the README says this is a 
  feature of phpMyAdmin.<br>
  </b>phpMyAdmin allows only editing of a table's content if the table contains 
  a primary or unique key.</p>
<p><b>phpMyAdmin always gives "Access denied" when using advanced authentification.<br>
  </b>This could happen for some reasons:
   <ul>
    <li>$stduser/$stdpassword is wrong. Try to turn off $adv_auth and use this username and password to connect to MySQL.
    <li>The username/password your specify in the login-dialog is wrong. Try the same as above and see if it works.
    
  <li>You have already setup a security mechanism for the phpMyAdmin-directory, 
    eg. a .htaccess file. This would interfere with phpMyAdmin's authentification, 
    so remove it. 
</ul>
<p><b>I would like to help out with the development of phpMyAdmin. How should I proceed?<br>
  </b>
  The following method is preferred for new developers:
  <ul>
  <li>fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:<br>
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmyadmin login<br>
  [Password: simply press the Enter key]<br>
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmyadmin checkout phpMyAdmin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or<br>
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmyadmin checkout phpMyAdmin-devel<br>
  [This will create a new sub-directory named phpMyAdmin or phpMyAdmin-devel]<br>
  <li>add your stuff
  <li>put the modified files (tar'ed and gzip'ed) inside the patch tracker of the
  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/" target="_blank">phpMyAdmin SourceForge account</a>.
  </ul>
 <p>Write access to the CVS tree is granted only to experienced developers who have already contributed something useful to phpMyAdmin.<br>
  Also, have a look at the file DEVELOPERS.
</p> 
<p><b>What's the preferred way of making phpMyAdmin secure against evil access?<br>
  </b> This depends on your system. If you're running a server which cannot be 
  accessed by other people, it's sufficient to use the directory protection bundled 
  with your webserver (with Apache you can use .htaccess files, for example). 
  If other people have telnet access to your server, it's not a good idea to store 
  the MySQL password in clear text in your config.inc.php3 file. You should use 
  phpMyAdmin's advanced authentification feature in this case. 
<p><b>How can I insert a null value into my table?<br>
  </b> Enter &quot;null&quot;, without the quotes, as the field's value. This 
  is especially useful for Timestamp ot AutoIncrement fields.
<p><b>I'm an ISP. Can I setup one central copy of phpMyAdmin or do I need to install 
  it for each customer?<br>
  </b> Since version 2.0.3, you can setup a central copy of phpMyAdmin for all 
  your users. The development of this feature was kindly sponsored by NetCologne 
  GmbH.<br>
  This requires a properly setup MySQL user management and phpMyAdmin's advanced 
  authentication. phpMyAdmin performs these steps, when authenticating a user:
<ol>
  <li>Select all entries from the mysql.user table where the username/password 
    matches the challenging user. If no rows are returned, the authentication 
    has failed. Otherwise, phpMyAdmin continues with step 2.</li>
  <li>If the user's global Select_Priv is &quot;N&quot; (ie the user is not allowed 
    to access <i>all</i> databases), phpMyAdmin searches the mysql.db table for 
    entries with Select_Priv = &quot;Y&quot; belonging to the user. If no entries 
    are found, the authentication has failed. Otherwise, phpMyAdmin shows all 
    databases the user is allowed to view.<br>
    If the user's global Select_Priv is &quot;Y&quot;, all databases in the system 
    are shown.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>This means that you need to add a user to the mysql database as following:<br>
  INSERT INTO user (Host, User, Password, Select_priv, Insert_priv, Update_priv, 
  Delete_priv, Create_priv, Drop_priv, Reload_priv, Shutdown_priv, Process_priv, 
  File_priv, Grant_priv, References_priv, Index_priv, Alter_priv) VALUES ('localhost', 
  'foo', PASSWORD('bar'), 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 
  'N', 'N', 'N') <br>
  INSERT INTO db (Host, Db, User, Select_priv, Insert_priv, Update_priv, Delete_priv, 
  Create_priv, Drop_priv, Grant_priv, References_priv, Index_priv, Alter_priv) 
  VALUES ('localhost', 'foo_db', 'foo', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', '', '', 
  '', '') <br>
  Then only the &quot;foo_db&quot; database will be displayed to user &quot;foo&quot;.</p>
