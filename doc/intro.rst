A word about users
------------------

Many people have difficulty understanding the concept of user
management with regards to phpMyAdmin. When a user logs in to
phpMyAdmin, that username and password are passed directly to MySQL.
phpMyAdmin does no account management on its own (other than allowing
one to manipulate the MySQL user account information); all users must
be valid MySQL users.

.. [#f1]

    phpMyAdmin can compress (:term:`ZIP`, :term:`GZip` or :term:`RFC 1952`
    formats) dumps and :term:`CSV` exports if you use PHP with
    :term:`Zlib` support (``--with-zlib``).
    Proper support may also need changes in :file:`php.ini`.
