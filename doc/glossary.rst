    primary key
      A primary key is an index over one or more fields in a table with
      unique values for every single row in this table. Every table should have
      a primary key for easier accessing/identifying data in this table. There
      can only be one primary key per table and it is named always **PRIMARY**.
      In fact, a primary key is just an :term:`unique key` with the name
      **PRIMARY**. If no primary key is defined MySQL will use first *unique
      key* as primary key if there is one.

      You can create the primary key when creating the table (in phpMyAdmin
      just check the primary key radio buttons for each field you wish to be
      part of the primary key).

      You can also add a primary key to an existing table with `ALTER` `TABLE`
      or `CREATE` `INDEX` (in phpMyAdmin you can just click on 'add index' on
      the table structure page below the listed fields).

      tab.

      Common table types are InnoDB and MyISAM, though many others exist and
      may be desirable in some situations.
