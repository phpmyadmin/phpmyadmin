Configuring phpMyAdmin
----------------------

phpMyAdmin has quite a lot of configuration settings, those are described in
:ref:`config`. There are several layers of the configuration.

The global settings can be configured in :file:`config.inc.php` as described in
:ref:`config`. This is only way to configure connections to databases and other
system wide settings.

On top of this there are user settings which can be persistently stored in
:ref:`linked-tables`, possibly automatically configured through
:ref:`zeroconf`.  If the :ref:`linked-tables` are not configured, the settings
are temporarily stored in the session data, these are valid only until you
logout.

You can also save the user configuration for further use, either download them
as a file or to the browser local storage. You can find both those options in
the :guilabel:`Settings` tab. The settings stored in browser local storage will
be automatically offered for loading upon your login to phpMyAdmin.
