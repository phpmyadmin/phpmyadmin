Requirements

     * PHP3, PHP4 or PHP5: phpMyAdmin widely uses the 'str_replace()' PHP
       function that was added in PHP 3.0.6, but was buggy up until
       PHP 3.0.8. Then you should not run this script with PHP3 < 3.0.8.
       PHP also needs to be compiled with MySQL support;
       If you want to display inline thumbnails of JPEGs with the
       original aspect ratio, you also need GD2 support in PHP.
     * MySQL 3.21 or newer (details);
     * a web-browser (doh!).

Introduction

   phpMyAdmin can manage a whole MySQL server (needs a super-user) as
   well as a single database. To accomplish the latter you'll need a
   properly set up MySQL user who can read/write only the desired
   database. It's up to you to look up the appropriate part in the MySQL
   manual.
   Currently phpMyAdmin can:
     * create and drop databases
     * create, copy, drop, rename and alter tables
     * do table maintenance
     * delete, edit and add fields
     * execute any SQL-statement, even batch-queries
     * manage keys on fields
     * load text files into tables
     * create (*) and read dumps of tables
     * export (*) data to CSV, XML and Latex formats
     * administer multiple servers
     * manage MySQL users and privileges
     * check referential integrity in MyISAM tables
     * using Query-by-example (QBE), create complex queries automatically
       connecting required tables
     * create PDF graphics of your Database layout
     * search globally in a database or a subset of it
     * transform stored data into any format using a set of predefined
       functions, like displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link or
       ...
     * support InnoDB tables and foreign keys (see FAQ 3.6)
     * communicate in 44 different languages

   (*)  phpMyAdmin can compress (Zip, GZip -RFC 1952- or Bzip2 formats)
   dumps and CSV exports if you use PHP4 >= 4.0.4 with Zlib support
   (--with-zlib) and/or Bzip2 support (--with-bz2).

Installation

   NOTE: phpMyAdmin does not apply any special security methods to the
   MySQL database server. It is still the system administrator's job to
   grant permissions on the MySQL databases properly. phpMyAdmin's
   "Privileges" page can be used for this.

   Warning for Mac users:if you are on a MacOS version before OS X,
   StuffIt unstuffs with Mac formats.
   So you'll have to resave as in BBEdit to Unix style ALL phpMyAdmin
   scripts before uploading them to your server, as PHP seems not to like
   Mac-style end of lines character ("\r").

   Quick Install:
    1. Untar or unzip the distribution (be sure to unzip the
       subdirectories): tar -xzvf phpMyAdmin_x.x.x.tar.gz in your
       webserver's document root. If you don't have direct access to your
       document root, put the files in a directory on your local machine,
       and, after step 3, transfer the directory on your web server
       using, for example, ftp.
    2. Open the file config.inc.php in your favorite editor and change
       the values for host, user, password and authentication mode to fit
       your environment. Here, "host" means the MySQL server. Also insert
       the correct value for $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri']. Have a look at
       Configuration section for an explanation of all values.
    3. It is recommended that you protect the directory in which you
       installed phpMyAdmin (unless it's on a closed intranet, or you
       wish to use HTTP or cookie authentication), for example with
       HTTP-AUTH (in a .htaccess file). See the FAQ section for
       additional information.
    4. Open the file <www.your-host.com>/<your-install-dir>/index.php in
       your browser. phpMyAdmin should now display a welcome screen and
       your databases, or a login dialog if using HTTP or cookie
       authentication mode.
    5. For a whole set of new features (bookmarks, comments, SQL-history,
       PDF-generation, field contents transformation, etc.) you need to
       create a set of tables in your database. Please look at your
       scripts/ directory, where you should find a file called
       create_tables.sql. (If you are using a Windows server, pay special
       attention to FAQ 1.23). You can already use your phpMyAdmin to
       create the tables for you. Please be aware that you may have to
       have special (administrator) privileges to create the database and
       tables. After having imported the create_tables.sql file, you
       should specify the table names in your config.inc.php file. The
       directives used for that can be found in the Configuration
       section.

   Upgrading from an older version:
     * Please do not copy your older config.inc.php over the new one: it
       may offer new configuration variables, and the new version may
       depend on these for normal behavior. It is suggested instead to
       insert your site values in the new one.

   Using authentication modes:
     * HTTP and cookie authentication modes are recommended in a
       multi-user environment where you want to give users access to
       their own database and don't want them to play around with others.
       Nevertheless be aware that MS Internet Explorer seems to be really
       buggy about cookies, at least till version 6. And PHP 4.1.1 is
       also a bit buggy in this area!
       Even in a single-user environment, you might prefer to use HTTP or
       cookie mode so that your user/password pair are not in clear in
       the configuration file.
     * HTTP and cookie authentication modes are more secure: the MySQL
       password does not need to be set in the phpMyAdmin configuration
       file (except for the "controluser" -see the Configuration
       section).
       However, keep in mind that the password travels in plain text,
       unless you are using the HTTPS protocol.
       In cookie mode, the password is stored, encrypted with the
       blowfish algorithm, in a temporary cookie.
     * For 'HTTP' and 'cookie' modes, phpMyAdmin needs a controluser that
       has only the SELECT privilege on the mysql.user (all columns
       except "Password"), mysql.db (all columns) & mysql.tables_priv
       (all columns except "Grantor" & "Timestamp") tables.
       You must specify the details for the controluser in the
       config.inc.php file under the $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser']&
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass'] settings.
       The following example assumes you want to use pma as the
       controluser and pmapass as the controlpass, but this is only an
       example: use something else in your file!
       Of course you have to replace localhost by the webserver's host if
       it's not the same as the MySQL server's one.

GRANT USAGE ON mysql.* TO 'pma'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pmapass';
GRANT SELECT (
    Host, User, Select_priv, Insert_priv, Update_priv, Delete_priv,
    Create_priv, Drop_priv, Reload_priv, Shutdown_priv, Process_priv,
    File_priv, Grant_priv, References_priv, Index_priv, Alter_priv,
    Show_db_priv, Super_priv, Create_tmp_table_priv, Lock_tables_priv,
    Execute_priv, Repl_slave_priv, Repl_client_priv
    ) ON mysql.user TO 'pma'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.db TO 'pma'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.host TO 'pma'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT (Host, Db, User, Table_name, Table_priv, Column_priv)
    ON mysql.tables_priv TO 'pma'@'localhost';

       If you are using an old MySQL version (below 4.0.2), please use
       this query instead of the second one:

GRANT SELECT (
    Host, User, Select_priv, Insert_priv, Update_priv, Delete_priv,
    Create_priv, Drop_priv, Reload_priv, Shutdown_priv, Process_priv,
    File_priv, Grant_priv, References_priv, Index_priv, Alter_priv
    ) ON mysql.user TO 'pma'@'localhost';

       ... and if you want to use the many new relation and bookmark
       features:

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON <pma_db>.* TO 'pma'@'localhost';

       (this of course requires you to have a special DB for phpMyAdmin,
       the contents will be explained later)
       Of course, the above queries only work if your MySQL version
       supports the GRANT command. This is the case since 3.22.11.
     * Then each of the true users should be granted a set of privileges
       on a set of particular databases. Normally you shouldn't give
       global privileges to an ordinary user, unless you understand the
       impact of those privileges (for example, you are creating a
       superuser).
       For example, to grant the user real_user with all privileges on
       the database user_base:
          GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON user_base.* TO 'real_user'@localhost
       IDENTIFIED BY 'real_password';
       What the user may now do is controlled entirely by the MySQL user
       management system.
       With HTTP or cookie authentication mode, you don't need to fill
       the user/password fields inside the $cfg['Servers'] array.

   'http' authentication mode:
     * Was called 'advanced' in versions before 2.2.3.
     * Introduced in 1.3.0, it uses Basic HTTP authentication method and
       allows you to login as any valid MySQL user.
     * Is only supported with PHP running as an Apache module, not with
       CGI.

   'cookie' authentication mode:
     * You can use this method as a replacement for the HTTP
       authentication (for example, if you're running IIS).
     * Obviously, the user must enable cookies in the browser.
     * With this mode, the use can truly logout of phpMyAdmin and login
       back with the same username.
     * If you want to login to arbitrary server see
       $cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] directive.

   'config' authentication mode:
     * This mode is the less secure one because it requires you to fill
       the $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] and
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] fields.
       But you don't need to setup a "controluser" here: using the
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['only_db'] might be enough.
     * In the ISP FAQ section, there is an entry explaining how to
       protect your configuration file.
     * For additional security in this mode, you may wish to consider the
       Host authentication $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['order'] and
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules'] configuration
       directives.

Configuration

   Warning for Mac users: PHP seems not to like Mac end of lines
   character ("\r"). So ensure you choose the option that allows to use
   the *nix end of line character ("\n") in your text editor before
   registering a script you have modified.

   All configurable data is placed in config.inc.php.

   $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] string
          Sets here the complete URL (with full path) to your phpMyAdmin
          version. E.g.
          http://www.your_web.net/path_to_your_phpMyAdmin_directory/.
          phpMyAdmin needs this setting, because of requirements of the
          HTTP protocol, explained in RFC2616, section 14.30.
          Don't forget the slash at the end of your URL. The URL must
          contain characters that are valid for a URL, and on some
          servers, the path is case-sensitive.
          Starting with version 2.3.0, you can try to leave this
          parameter empty, because the program tries to auto-detect its
          proper value. Additional details are in the configuration file.
          Alternatively, this setting can be dynamically completed. For
          example, you can try to use such a kind of code:

$cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] = (!empty($_SERVER['HTTPS']) ? 'https' : 'http') . '://'
                       . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']
                       . (!empty($_SERVER['SERVER_PORT']) ? ':' . $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'] : '')
                       . substr($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], 0, strrpos($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], '/')+1);

    or

$cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] = (!empty($_SERVER['HTTPS']) ? 'https' : 'http') . '://'
                       . $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']
                       . (!empty($_SERVER['SERVER_PORT']) ? ':' . $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'] : '')
                       . substr($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'], 0, strrpos($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'], '/')+1);


          Please note that the $_SERVER array doesn't exist in
          PHP < 4.1.0. Try to replace $_SERVER by $HTTP_SERVER_VARS or
          $GLOBALS in this case.

   $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri_DisableWarning'] boolean
          By default, when you leave $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] empty, and
          the system detects your absolute URI automatically, we display
          a warning to remind you. If you have tested the automatic
          detection, and it works perfectly for your setup, then you can
          set this variable to squelch the warning.

   $cfg['PmaNoRelation_DisableWarning'] boolean
          Starting with version 2.3.0 phpMyAdmin offers a lot of features
          to work with master / foreign - tables (see
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']).
          If you tried to set this up and it does not work for you, have
          a look on the "Structure" page of one database where you would
          like to use it. You will find a link that will analyze why
          those features have been disabled.
          If you do not want to use those features set this variable to
          TRUE to stop this message from appearing.

   $cfg['blowfish_secret'] string
          Starting with version 2.5.2, the 'cookie' auth_type uses
          blowfish algorithm to encrypt the password.
          If at least one server configuration uses 'cookie' auth_type,
          enter here a passphrase that will be used by blowfish.

   $cfg['Servers'] array
          Since version 1.4.2, phpMyAdmin supports the administration of
          multiple MySQL servers. Therefore, a $cfg['Servers']-array has
          been added which contains the login information for the
          different servers. The first $cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']
          contains the hostname of the first server, the second
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] the hostname of the second server,
          etc. If you have only one server to administer, simply leave
          free the hostname of the other $cfg['Server']-entries.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] string
          The hostname or IP address of your $i-th MySQL-server. E.g.
          localhost.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['port'] string
          The port-number of your $i-th MySQL-server. Default is 3306
          (leave blank). If you use "localhost" as the hostname, MySQL
          ignores this port number and connects with the socket, so if
          you want to connect to a port different from the default port,
          use "127.0.0.1" or the real hostname in
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'].

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['socket'] string
          The path to the socket to use. Leave blank for default.
          To use the socket feature you must run PHP 3.0.10 or more.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['connect_type'] string
          What type connection to use with the MySQL server. Your options
          are 'socket' & 'tcp'. It defaults to 'tcp' as that is nearly
          guaranteed to be available on all MySQL servers, while sockets
          are not supported on some platforms.
          To use the socket mode, your MySQL server must be on the same
          machine as the Web server.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['compress'] boolean
          Whether to use a compressed protocol for the MySQL server
          connection or not (experimental).
          This feature requires PHP >= 4.3.0.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser'] string
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass'] string
          When using HTTP or cookie authentication modes (or 'config'
          authentication mode since phpMyAdmin 2.2.1), you need to supply
          the details of a MySQL account that has SELECT privilege on the
          mysql.user (all columns except "Password"), mysql.db (all
          columns) & mysql.tables_priv (all columns except "Grantor" &
          "Timestamp") tables. This account is used to check what
          databases the user will see at login.
          Please see the install section on "Using HTTP authentication"
          for more information.
          Note that if you try login to phpMyAdmin with this
          "controluser", you could get some errors, depending the exact
          privileges you gave to the "controluser". phpMyAdmin does not
          support a direct login with the "controluser".
          In versions before 2.2.5, those were called "stduser/stdpass".

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] string ['http'|'cookie'|'config']
          Whether config or cookie or http authentication should be used
          for this server.

          + 'config' authentication ($auth_type = 'config') is the plain
            old way: username and password are stored in config.inc.php.
          + 'cookie' authentication mode ($auth_type = 'cookie') as
            introduced in 2.2.3 allows you to log in as any valid MySQL
            user with the help of cookies. Log name and password are
            stored in cookies during the session and password is deleted
            when it ends. This can also allow you to login in arbitrary
            server if $cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] enabled.
          + 'http' authentication (was called 'advanced' in older
            versions) ($auth_type = 'http') as introduced in 1.3.0 allows
            you to log in as any valid MySQL user via HTTP-Auth.

          Please see the install section on "Using authentication modes"
          for more information.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] string
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] string
          The user/password-pair which phpMyAdmin will use to connect to
          this MySQL-server. This user/password pair is not needed when
          HTTP or cookie authentication is used, and should be empty.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['only_db'] string or array
          If set to a(an array of) database name(s), only this(these)
          database(s) will be shown to the user. Since phpMyAdmin 2.2.1,
          this/these database(s) name(s) may contain MySQL wildcards
          characters ("_" and "%"): if you want to use literal instances
          of these characters, escape them (I.E. use 'my\_db' and not
          'my_db').
          This setting is an efficient way to lower the server charge
          since the latter does not need to send MySQL requests to build
          the available database list. But it does not replace the
          privileges rules of the MySQL database server. If set, it just
          means only these databases will be displayed but not that all
          other databases can't be used.
          An example of using more that one database:
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['only_db'] = array('db1', 'db2');
          As of phpMyAdmin 2.5.5 the order inside the array is used for
          sorting the databases in the left frame, so that you can
          individually arrange your databases.
          If you want to have certain tables at the top, but don't care
          about the others, you do not need to specify all other
          databases. Use: $cfg['Servers'][$i]['only_db'] = array('db3',
          'db4', '*'); instead to tell phpMyAdmin that it should display
          db3 and db4 on top, and the rest in alphabetic order.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['verbose'] string
          Only useful when using phpMyAdmin with multiple server entries.
          If set, this string will be displayed instead of the hostname
          in the pull-down menu on the main page. This can be useful if
          you want to show only certain databases on your system, for
          example.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb'] string
          Starting with version 2.3.0 phpMyAdmin offers a lot of features
          to work with master / foreign - tables. To use those as well as
          the bookmark feature you need special tables with a predefined
          structure, which we explain below.
          See the Quick Install section in this document for a quick way
          of creating those tables. Also, if you are using a Windows
          server, read FAQ 1.23.
          If you are the only user of this phpMyAdmin installation, you
          can use your current database to store those special tables; in
          this case, just put your current database name in
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb'].
          If you are setting up a multi-user phpMyAdmin installation, you
          will need to create a new database and setup special
          privileges, so, as superuser:

          + create a new database for phpMyAdmin:
              CREATE DATABASE phpmyadmin;
            Note that "controluser" must have SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and
            DELETE privileges on this database. Here is a query to set up
            those privileges (using "phpmyadmin" as the database name,
            and "pma" as the controluser):
              GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON phpmyadmin.* to
            'pma'@'localhost';
            do not give any other user rights on this database.
          + enter the database name in $cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['bookmarktable'] string
          Since release 2.2.0 phpMyAdmin allows to bookmark queries. This
          can be useful for queries you often run.
          To allow the usage of this functionality you have to:

          + set up "pmadb" as described above
          + within this database create a table following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE `pma_bookmark` (
                   id int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL auto_increment,
                   dbase varchar(255) NOT NULL,
                   user varchar(255) NOT NULL,
                   label varchar(255) NOT NULL,
                   query text NOT NULL,
                   PRIMARY KEY (id)
                 ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Bookmarks';
          + enter the table name in $cfg['Servers'][$i]['bookmarktable']

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['relation'] string
          Since release 2.2.4 you can describe, in a special 'relation'
          table, which field is a key in another table (a foreign key).
          phpMyAdmin currently uses this to

          + make clickable, when you browse the master table, the data
            values that point to the foreign table;
          + display in an optional tool-tip the "display field" when
            browsing the master table, if you move the mouse to a column
            containing a foreign key (use also the 'table_info' table);
            (see FAQ 6.7)
          + in edit/insert mode, display a drop-down list of possible
            foreign keys (key value and "display field" are shown)
            (see FAQ 6.21)
          + display links on the table properties page, to check
            referential integrity (display missing foreign keys) for each
            described key;
          + in query-by-example, create automatic joins (see FAQ 6.6)
          + enable you to get a PDF schema of your database (also uses
            the table_coords table).

          The keys can be numeric or character.
          To allow the usage of this functionality the superuser has to:

          + set up "pmadb" as described above
          + within this database create a table following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE `pma_relation` (
                   `master_db` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `master_table` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `master_field` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `foreign_db` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `foreign_table` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `foreign_field` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   PRIMARY KEY (`master_db`, `master_table`,
            `master_field`),
                   KEY foreign_field (foreign_db, foreign_table)
                 ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Relation table';
          + put the relation table name in
            $cfg['Servers'][$i]['relation']
          + now as normal user open phpMyAdmin and for each one of your
            tables where you want to use this feature, click
            "Structure/Relation view/" and choose foreign fields.

          Please note that in the current (2.3.0) version, master_db must
          be the same as foreign_db. Those fields have been put in future
          development of the cross-db relations.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_info'] string
          Since release 2.3.0 you can describe, in a special 'table_info'
          table, which field is to be displayed as a tool-tip when moving
          the cursor over the corresponding key.
          This configuration variable will hold the name of this special
          table. To allow the usage of this functionality the superuser
          has to:

          + set up "pmadb" as described above
          + within this database create a table following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE `pma_table_info` (
                   `db_name` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `table_name` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `display_field` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   PRIMARY KEY (`db_name`, `table_name`)
                 ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Table information for
            phpMyAdmin';
          + put the table name in $cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_info']
          + then for each table where you want to use this feature, click
            "Structure/Relation view/Choose field to display" to choose
            the field.

          Usage tip: Display field.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_coords'] string
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['pdf_pages'] string
          Since release 2.3.0 you can have phpMyAdmin create PDF pages
          showing the relations between your tables. To do this it needs
          two tables "pdf_pages" (storing information about the available
          PDF pages) and "table_coords" (storing coordinates where each
          table will be placed on a PDF schema output).
          You must be using the "relation" feature and have a table of
          PDF pages (see $cfg['Servers'][$i]['pdf_pages']) to create PDF
          output.
          To allow the usage of this functionality the superuser has to:

          + set up "pmadb" as described above
          + within this database create a table following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE `pma_table_coords` (
                   `db_name` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `table_name` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `pdf_page_number` int NOT NULL default '0',
                   `x` float unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
                   `y` float unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
                   PRIMARY KEY (`db_name`, `table_name`,
            `pdf_page_number`)
                 ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Table coordinates for phpMyAdmin
            PDF output';
          + also within this database create:
                 CREATE TABLE `pma_pdf_pages` (
                   `db_name` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `page_nr` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
                   `page_descr` varchar(50) NOT NULL default '',
                   PRIMARY KEY (page_nr),
                   KEY (db_name)
                 ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='PDF Relationpages for PMA';
          + put the first table name in
            $cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_coords'] and the second table name
            in $cfg['Servers'][$i]['pdf_pages']

          Usage tips: PDF output.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['column_info'] string
          Since release 2.3.0 you can store comments to describe each
          column for each table. These will then be shown on the
          "printview".
          Starting with release 2.5.0, comments are consequently used on
          the table property pages and table browse view, showing up as
          tool-tips above the column name (properties page) or embedded
          within the header of table in browse view. They can also be
          shown in a table dump. Please see the relevant configuration
          directives later on.
          Also new in release 2.5.0 is a mime-transformation system which
          is also based on the following table structure. See
          Transformations for further information. To use the
          mime-transformation system, your column_info table has to have
          the three new fields 'mimetype', 'transformation',
          'transformation_options'.
          To allow the usage of this functionality the superuser has to:

          + set up "pmadb" as described above
          + within this database create a table following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE `pma_column_info` (
                   id int(5) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
                   db_name varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   table_name varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   column_name varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `comment` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
                   mimetype varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
                   transformation varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
                   transformation_options varchar(255) NOT NULL default
            '',
                   PRIMARY KEY (id),
                   UNIQUE KEY db_name (db_name, table_name, column_name)
                 ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Comments for Columns';
          + put the table name in $cfg['Servers'][$i]['column_info']
          + To update your PRE-2.5.0 Column_comments Table use this:
                 ALTER TABLE `pma_column_comments`
                   ADD `mimetype` VARCHAR( 255 ) NOT NULL ,
                   ADD `transformation` VARCHAR( 255 ) NOT NULL ,
                   ADD `transformation_options` VARCHAR( 255 ) NOT NULL ;
            and remember that the Variable in config.inc.php has been
            renamed from
            $cfg['Servers'][$i]['column_comments'] to
            $cfg['Servers'][$i]['column_info']

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['history'] string
          Since release 2.5.0 you can store your SQL history, which means
          all queries you entered manually into the phpMyAdmin interface.
          If you don't want to use a table- based history, you can use
          the JavaScript-based history. Using that, all your history
          items are deleted when closing the window.
          Using $cfg['QueryHistoryMax'] you can specify an amount of
          history items you want to have on hold. On every login, this
          list gets cut to the maximum amount.
          The query history is only available if you use the
          JavaScript-based query window, see $cfg['QueryFrame'].
          To allow the usage of this functionality the superuser has to:

          + set up "pmadb" as described above
          + within this database create a table following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE `pma_history` (
                   `id` BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
                   `username` VARCHAR( 64 ) NOT NULL ,
                   `db` VARCHAR( 64 ) NOT NULL ,
                   `table` VARCHAR( 64 ) NOT NULL ,
                   `timevalue` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL ,
                   `sqlquery` TEXT NOT NULL ,
                   PRIMARY KEY ( `id` ) ,
                   INDEX ( `username` , `db` , `table` , `timevalue` )
                   ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='SQL history';
          + put the table name in $cfg['Servers'][$i]['history']

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['verbose_check'] string
          Because release 2.5.0 introduced the new MIME-transformation
          support, the column_info table got enhanced with three new
          fields. If the above variable is set to TRUE (default)
          phpMyAdmin will check if you have the latest table structure
          available. If not, it will emit a warning to the superuser.
          You can disable this checking behavior by setting the variable
          to false, which should offer a performance increase.
          Recommended to set to FALSE, when you are sure, your table
          structure is up to date.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['order'] string
          If your rule order is empty, then IP authentication is
          disabled.
          If your rule order is set to 'deny,allow' then the system
          applies all deny rules followed by allow rules. Access is
          allowed by default. Any client which does not match a Deny
          command or does match an Allow command will be allowed access
          to the server.
          If your rule order is set to 'allow,deny' then the system
          applies all allow rules followed by deny rules. Access is
          denied by default. Any client which does not match an Allow
          directive or does match a Deny directive will be denied access
          to the server.
          If your rule order is set to 'explicit', the authentication is
          performed in a similar fashion to rule order 'deny,allow', with
          the added restriction that your host/username combination must
          be listed in the allow rules, and not listed in the deny rules.
          This is the most secure means of using Allow/Deny rules, and
          was available in Apache by specifying allow and deny rules
          without setting any order.

   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules'] array of strings
          The general format for the rules is as such:
                <'allow' | 'deny'> <username> [from] <ipmask>
          If you wish to match all users, it is possible to use a '%' as
          a wildcard in the username field.
          There are a few shortcuts you can use in the ipmask field as
          well:
               'all' -> 0.0.0.0/0
               'localhost' -> 127.0.0.1/8
          Having an empty rule list is equivalent to either using 'allow
          % from all' if your rule order is set to 'deny,allow' or 'deny
          % from all' if your rule order is set to 'allow,deny' or
          'explicit'.
          For the IP matching system, the following work:
          xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (an exact IP address)
          xxx.xxx.xxx.[yyy-zzz] (an IP address range)
          xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/nn (CIDR, Classless Inter-Domain Routing type
          IP addresses)
          But the following does not work:
          xxx.xxx.xxx.xx[yyy-zzz] (partial IP address range)

   $cfg['ServerDefault'] integer
          If you have more than one server configured, you can set
          $cfg['ServerDefault'] to any one of them to autoconnect to that
          server when phpMyAdmin is started, or set it to 0 to be given a
          list of servers without logging in.
          If you have only one server configured, $cfg['ServerDefault']
          MUST be set to that server.

   $cfg['OBGzip'] string/boolean
          Defines whether to use GZip output buffering for increased
          speed in HTTP transfers.
          Set to true/false for enabling/disabling. When set to 'auto'
          (string), phpMyAdmin tries to enable output buffering and will
          automatically disable it, if your browser has some problems
          with buffering. IE6 with a certain patch is known to cause data
          corruption having enabled buffering.

   $cfg['PersistentConnections'] boolean
          Whether persistent connections should be used or not
          (mysql_connect or mysql_pconnect).

   $cfg['ExecTimeLimit'] integer [number of seconds]
          Set the number of seconds a script is allowed to run. If
          seconds is set to zero, no time limit is imposed.
          This setting is used while importing/exporting dump files but
          has no effect when PHP is running in safe mode.

   $cfg['SkipLockedTables'] boolean
          Mark used tables and make it possible to show databases with
          locked tables (since 3.23.30).

   $cfg['ShowSQL'] boolean
          Defines whether SQL-queries generated by phpMyAdmin should be
          displayed or not.

   $cfg['AllowUserDropDatabase'] boolean
          Defines whether normal users (non-administrator) are allowed to
          delete their own database or not. If set as FALSE, the link
          "Drop Database" will not be shown, and even a "DROP DATABASE
          mydatabase" will be rejected. Quite practical for ISP's with
          many customers.

   $cfg['Confirm'] boolean
          Whether a warning ("Are your really sure..") should be
          displayed when you're about to loose data.

   $cfg['LoginCookieRecall'] boolean
          Define whether the previous login should be recalled or not in
          cookie authentication mode.

   $cfg['UseDbSearch'] boolean
          Define whether the "search string inside database" is enabled
          or not.

   $cfg['IgnoreMultiSubmitErrors'] boolean
          Define whether phpMyAdmin will continue executing a multi-query
          statement if one of the queries fails. Default is to abort
          execution.

   $cfg['VerboseMultiSubmit'] boolean
          Define whether phpMyAdmin will output the results of each query
          of a multi-query statement embedded into the SQL output as
          inline comments. Defaults to TRUE.

   $cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] boolean
          If enabled allows you to login to arbitrary server using cookie
          auth.
          NOTE: Please use this carefully, as this may allow to access
          MySQL servers behind firewall where your http server is placed.

   $cfg['LeftFrameLight'] boolean
          Defines whether to use select-based menu and display only the
          current tables in the left frame (smaller page). Only in
          Non-Lightmode you can use the feature to display nested folders
          using $cfg['LeftFrameTableSeparator']

   $cfg['LeftFrameTableSeparator'] string
          Defines a string to be used to nest table spaces. Defaults to
          '__'. This means if you have tables like 'first__second__third'
          this will be shown as a three-level hierarchie like: first >
          second > third. If set to FALSE or empty, the feature is
          disabled. NOTE: You shall not use this Separator in a table
          name at the beginning or end of a table name, or multiple times
          after another without any other characters in between.

   $cfg['LeftFrameTableLevel'] string
          Defines how many sublevels should be displayed when splitting
          up tables by the above Separator.

   $cfg['ShowTooltip'] boolean
          Defines whether to display table comment as tool-tip in left
          frame or not.

   $cfg['ShowTooltipAliasDB'] boolean
          If tool-tips are enabled and a DB comment is set, this will
          flip the comment and the real name. That means, if you have a
          table called 'user0001' and add the comment 'MyName' on it, you
          will see the name 'MyName' used consequently in the left frame
          and the tool-tip shows the real name of the DB.

   $cfg['ShowTooltipAliasTB'] boolean
          Same as $cfg['ShowTooltipAliasDB'], except this works for table
          names.

   $cfg['ShowStats'] boolean
          Defines whether to display space usage and statistics about
          databases and tables or not.
          Note that statistics requires at least MySQL 3.23.3 and that,
          at this date, MySQL doesn't return such information for
          Berkeley DB tables.

   $cfg['ShowMysqlInfo'] boolean
          $cfg['ShowMysqlVars'] boolean
          $cfg['ShowPhpInfo'] boolean
          $cfg['ShowChgPassword'] boolean
          Defines whether to display the "MySQL runtime information",
          "MySQL system variables", "PHP information" and "Change
          password " links or not for simple users at the starting main
          (right) frame. This setting does not check MySQL commands
          entered directly.
          Please note that to block the usage of phpinfo() in scripts,
          you have to put this in your php.ini:
              disable_functions = phpinfo()
          Also note that enabling the "Change password " link has no
          effect with "config" authentication mode: because of the hard
          coded password value in the configuration file, end users can't
          be allowed to change their passwords.

   $cfg['SuggestDBName'] boolean
          Defines whether to suggest a database name on the "Create
          Database" form or to keep the textfield empty.

   $cfg['ShowBlob'] boolean
          Defines whether BLOB fields are shown when browsing a table's
          content or not.

   $cfg['NavigationBarIconic'] boolean
          Defines whether navigation bar buttons contain text or symbols
          only.

   $cfg['ShowAll'] boolean
          Defines whether an user should be displayed a "show all
          (records)" button in browse mode or not.

   $cfg['MaxRows'] integer
          Number of rows displayed when browsing a result set. If the
          result set contains more rows, Previous/Next links will be
          shown.

   $cfg['Order'] string [DESC|ASC|SMART]
          Defines whether fields are displayed in ascending (ASC) order,
          in descending (DESC) order or in a "smart" (SMART) order - I.E.
          descending order for fields of type TIME, DATE, DATETIME &
          TIMESTAMP, ascending order else- by default.

   $cfg['ProtectBinary'] boolean or string
          Defines whether BLOB or BINARY fields are protected from
          edition when browsing a table's content or not. Valid values
          are:
          - FALSE to allow edition of all fields;
          - blob to allow edition of all fields except BLOBS;
          - all to disallow edition of all BINARY or BLOB fields.

   $cfg['ShowFunctionFields'] boolean
          Defines whether MySQL functions fields should be displayed or
          not in edit/insert mode.

   $cfg['CharEditing'] string
          Defines which type of editing controls should be used for CHAR
          and VARCHAR fields. Possible values are:

          + input - this allows to limit size of text to size of field in
            MySQL, but has problems with newlines in fields
          + textarea - no problems with newlines in fields, but also no
            length limitations

          Default is old behavior so input.

   $cfg['ZipDump'] boolean
          $cfg['GZipDump'] boolean
          $cfg['BZipDump'] boolean
          Defines whether to allow the use of zip/GZip/BZip2 compression
          when creating a dump file or not.

   $cfg['CompressOnFly'] boolean
          Defines whether to allow ont the fly compression for GZip/BZip2
          compressed exports. This doesn't affect smaller dumps and
          allows to create larger dumps, that won't fit otherwise in
          memory due to php memory limit. Produced files contain more
          GZip/BZip2 headers, but all normal programs handles this
          correctly.

   $cfg['LightTabs'] string
          If set to True, do use less graphically intense tabs on the top
          of the mainframe.

   $cfg['PropertiesIconic'] string
          If set to True, will display icons instead of text for db and
          table properties links (like 'Browse', 'Select', 'Insert',
          ...).
          Can be set to 'both' if you want icons AND text.
          When set to False, will only show text.

   $cfg['PropertiesNumColumns'] integer
          How many columns will be utilized to display the tables on the
          database property view? Default is 1 column. When setting this
          to a value larger than 1, the type of the database will be
          omitted for more display space.

   $cfg['DefaultTabServer'] string
          Defines the tab displayed by default on server view. Possible
          values: "main.php" (recommended for multi-user setups),
          "server_databases.php", "server_status.php",
          "server_variables.php", "server_privileges.php" or
          "server_processlist.php".

   $cfg['DefaultTabDatabase'] string
          Defines the tab displayed by default on database view. Possible
          values: "db_details_structure.php", "db_details.php" or
          "db_search.php".

   $cfg['DefaultTabTable'] string
          Defines the tab displayed by default on table view. Possible
          values: "tbl_properties_structure.php", "tbl_properties.php",
          "tbl_select.php" or "tbl_change.php".

   $cfg['MySQLManualBase'] string
          If set to an URL which points to the MySQL documentation (type
          depends on $cfg['MySQLManualType']), appropriate help links are
          generated.
          See MySQL Documentation page for more information about MySQL
          manuals and their types.

   $cfg['MySQLManualType'] string
          Type of MySQL documentation:

          + old - old style used in phpMyAdmin 2.3.0 and sooner
          + searchable - "Searchable, with user comments"
          + chapters - "HTML, one page per chapter"
          + big - "HTML, all on one page"
          + none - do not show documentation links

   $cfg['DefaultLang'] string
          Defines the default language to use, if not browser-defined or
          user-defined.
          See the select_lang.inc.php script to know the valid values for
          this setting.

   $cfg['Lang'] string
          Force: always use this language (must be defined in the
          select_lang.inc.php script).

   $cfg['DefaultCharset'] string
          Default character set to use for recoding of MySQL queries.
          This must be enabled and it's described by
          $cfg['AllowAnywhereRecoding'] option.
          You can give here any character set which is in
          $cfg['AvailableCharsets'] array and this is just default
          choice, user can select any of them.

   $cfg['AllowAnywhereRecoding'] boolean
          Allow character set recoding of MySQL queries. You need recode
          or iconv support (compiled in or module) in PHP to allow MySQL
          queries recoding and used language file must have it enabled
          (by default only these which are in Unicode, just to avoid
          losing some characters).

   $cfg['RecodingEngine'] string
          You can select here which functions will be used for character
          set conversion. Possible values are:

          + auto - automatically use available one (first is tested
            iconv, then recode)
          + iconv - use iconv or libiconv functions
          + recode - use recode_string function

          Default is auto.

   $cfg['IconvExtraParams'] string
          Specify some parameters for iconv used in charset conversion.
          See iconv documentation for details.

   $cfg['AvailableCharsets'] array
          Available character sets for MySQL conversion. You can add your
          own (any of supported by recode/iconv) or remove these which
          you don't use. Character sets will be shown in same order as
          here listed, so if you frequently use some of these move them
          to the top.

   $cfg['GD2Available'] string
          Specifies whether GD >= 2 is available. If yes it can be used
          for MIME transformations.
          Possible values are:

          + auto - automatically detect, this is a bit expensive
            operation for php < 4.3.0 so it is preffered to change this
            according to your server real possibilities
          + yes - GD 2 functions can be used
          + no - GD 2 function can not be used

          Default is auto.

   $cfg['LeftWidth'] integer
          Left frame width in pixel.

   $cfg['LeftBgColor'] string [HTML color]
          $cfg['RightBgColor'] string [HTML color]
          The background colors (HTML) used for both the frames.

   $cfg['RightBgImage'] string
          The URI of the background image used for the right frame. It
          can be absolute as well as relative from your phpMyAdmin
          directory.

   $cfg['LeftPointerColor'] string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) used for the pointer in the left frame (does
          not work with Netscape 4).

   $cfg['Border'] integer
          The size of a table's border.

   $cfg['ThBgcolor'] string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) used for table headers.

   $cfg['BgcolorOne'] string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) #1 for table rows.

   $cfg['BgcolorTwo'] string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) #2 for table rows.

   $cfg['BrowsePointerColor'] string [HTML color]
          $cfg['BrowseMarkerColor'] string [HTML color]
          The colors (HTML) uses for the pointer and the marker in browse
          mode (does not work with Netscape 4).
          The former feature highlights the row over which your mouse is
          passing and the latter lets you visually mark/unmark rows by
          clicking on them.
          You can disable both of these features by emptying the
          respective directive.

   $cfg['TextareaCols'] integer
          $cfg['TextareaRows'] integer
          $cfg['CharTextareaCols'] integer
          $cfg['CharTextareaRows'] integer
          Number of columns and rows for the textareas.
          This value will be emphasized (*2) for SQL query textareas and
          (*1.25) for SQL textareas inside the query window.
          The Char* values are used for CHAR and VARCHAR editing (if
          configured via $cfg['CharEditing']).

   $cfg['LongtextDoubleTextarea'] boolean
          Defines whether textarea for LONGTEXT fields should have double
          size.

   $cfg['TextareaAutoSelect'] boolean
          Defines if the whole textarea of the query box will be selected
          on click.

   $cfg['CtrlArrowsMoving'] boolean
          Enable Ctrl+Arrows moving between fields when editing?

   $cfg['LimitChars'] integer
          Maximal number of Chars showed in any non-numeric field on
          browse view. Can be turned off by a toggle button on the browse
          page.

   $cfg['ModifyDeleteAtLeft'] boolean
          $cfg['ModifyDeleteAtRight'] boolean
          Defines the place where modify and delete links would be put
          when tables contents are displayed (you may have them displayed
          both at the left and at the right). "Left" and "right" are
          parsed as "top" and "bottom" with vertical display mode.

   $cfg['DefaultDisplay'] string
          $cfg['HeaderFlipType'] string
          There are 3 display modes: horizontal, horizontalflipped and
          vertical. Define which one is displayed by default. The first
          mode displays each row on a horizontal line, the second rotates
          the headers by 90 degrees, so you can use descriptive headers
          even though fields only contain small values and still print
          them out. The vertical mode sorts each row on a vertical
          lineup.
          The HeaderFlipType can be set to 'css' or 'faked'. When using
          'css' the rotation of the header for horizontalflipped is done
          via CSS. If set to 'faked' PHP does the transformation for you,
          but of course this does not look as good as CSS.

   $cfg['DefaultPropDisplay'] string
          When editing/creating new columns in a table all fields
          normally get lined up one field a line. (default:
          'horizontal'). If you set this to 'vertical' you can have each
          field lined up vertically beneath each other. You can save up a
          lot of place on the horizontal direction and no longer have to
          scroll.

   $cfg['ShowBrowseComments'] boolean
          $cfg['ShowPropertyComments'] boolean
          By setting the corresponding variable to TRUE you can enable
          the display of column comments in Browse or Property display.
          In browse mode, the comments are show inside the header. In
          property mode, comments are displayed using a CSS-formatted
          dashed-line below the name of the field. The comment is shown
          as a tool-tip for that field.

   $cfg['UploadDir'] string
          The name of the directory, where SQL files have been uploaded
          by other means than phpMyAdmin (for example, ftp). Those files
          are available under a drop-down box when you click the database
          name, then the SQL tab.
          Please note that the file names must have the suffix ".sql" (or
          ".sql.bz2" or ".sql.gz" if support for compressed formats is
          enabled).
          This feature is useful when your file is too big to be uploaded
          via HTTP, or when file uploads are disabled in PHP.
          Please note that if PHP is running in safe mode, this directory
          must be owned by the same user as the owner of the phpMyAdmin
          scripts.

   $cfg['docSQLDir'] string
          The name of the directory, where docSQL files can be uploaded
          for import into phpMyAdmin.
          Please note that if PHP is running in safe mode, this directory
          must be owned by the same user as the owner of the phpMyAdmin
          scripts.

   $cfg['SaveDir'] string
          The name of the directory, where dumps can be saved.
          Please note that the directory has to be writable for user
          running webserver.
          Please note that if PHP is running in safe mode, this directory
          must be owned by the same user as the owner of the phpMyAdmin
          scripts.

   $cfg['Export'] array
          In this array are defined default parameters for export, names
          of items are simmilar to texts seen on export page, so you can
          easily identify what they mean.

   $cfg['RepeatCells'] integer
          Repeat the headers every X cells, or 0 to deactivate.

   $cfg['QueryFrame'] boolean
          $cfg['QueryFrameJS'] boolean
          $cfg['QueryFrameDebug'] boolean
          $cfg['QueryWindowWidth'] integer
          $cfg['QueryWindowHeight'] integer
          $cfg['QueryHistoryDB'] boolean
          $cfg['QueryWindowDefTab'] string
          $cfg['QueryHistoryMax'] integer
          All those variables affect the new query frame/window. When
          $cfg['QueryFrame'] is set to true a new frame is embedded on
          the left with a small area. Clicking on that results in opening
          a direct interface to enter SQL queries.
          When $cfg['QueryFrameJS'] is set to true, clicking on that link
          opens a new custom sized browser window
          ($cfg['QueryWindowWidth'], $cfg['QueryWindowWidth'] - both
          integers for the size in pixels). If set to false, clicking on
          the link only opens the SQL input in the mainframe.
          The usage of the JavaScript query window is recommended if you
          have a JavaScript enabled browser. Basic functions are used to
          exchange quite a few variables, so most 4th generation browsers
          should be capable to use that feature. It currently is only
          tested with Internet Explorer 6 and Mozilla 1.x.
          If $cfg['QueryHistoryDB'] is set to TRUE, all your Queries are
          logged to a table, which has to be created by you (see
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['history']). If set to FALSE, all your
          queries will be appended to the form, but only as long as your
          window is opened they remain saved.
          When using the JavaScript based query window, it will always
          get updated when you click on a new table/db to browse and will
          focus if you click on "Edit SQL" after using a query. You can
          suppress updating the query window by checking the box "Do not
          overwrite this query from outside the window" below the query
          textarea. Then you can browse tables/databases in the
          background without losing the contents of the textarea, so this
          is especially useful when composing a query with tables you
          first have to look in. The checkbox will get automatically
          checked whenever you change the contents of the textarea.
          Please uncheck the button whenever you definitely want the
          query window to get updated even though you have made
          alterations.
          If $cfg['QueryHistoryDB'] is set to TRUE you can specify the
          amount of saved history items using $cfg['QueryHistoryMax'].
          The query window also has a custom tabbed look to group the
          features. Using the variable $cfg['QueryWindowDefTab'] you can
          specify the default tab to be used when opening the query
          window. It can be set to either 'sql', 'files', 'history' or
          'full'.
          The variable $cfg['QueryFrameDebug'] can be used by developers
          for easier future feature integration.

   $cfg['BrowseMIME'] boolean
          Enable MIME-transformations.

   $cfg['MaxExactCount'] integer
          Determines for how large tables phpMyAdmin should get exact row
          count by SELECT COUNT. If approximate row count is smaller than
          this value, SELECT COUNT will be used, otherwise only value
          returned by SHOW TABLE STATUS.

   $cfg['WYSIWYG-PDF'] boolean
          Utilizes a WYSIWYG editing control to easily place elements of
          a PDF page. By clicking on the button 'toggle scratchboard' on
          the page where you edit x/y coordinates of those elements you
          can activate a scratchboard where all your elements are placed.
          By clicking on an element, you can move them around in the
          pre-defined area and the x/y coordinates will get updated
          dynamically. Likewise, when entering a new position directly
          into the input field, the new position in the scratchboard
          changes after your cursors leaves the input field.
          You have to click on the 'OK'-button below the tables to save
          the new positions. If you want to place a new element, first
          add it to the table of elements and then you can drag the new
          element around.
          By changing the paper size and the orientation you can change
          the size of the scratchboard as well. You can do so by just
          changing the dropdown field below, and the scratchboard will
          resize automatically, without interfering with the current
          placement of the elements.
          If ever an element gets out of range you can either enlarge the
          paper size or click on the 'reset' button to place all elements
          below each other.
          NOTE: You have to use a recent browser like IE6 or Mozilla to
          get this control to work. The basic Drag&Drop script
          functionality was kindly borrowed from www.youngpup.net and is
          underlying so specific license.

   $cfg['SQP']['fmtType'] string [html|none]
          The main use of the new SQL Parser is to pretty-print SQL
          queries. By default we use HTML to format the query, but you
          can disable this by setting this variable to 'none'.

   $cfg['SQP']['fmtInd'] float
          $cfg['SQP']['fmtIndUnit'] string [em|px|pt|ex]
          For the pretty-printing of SQL queries, under some cases the
          part of a query inside a bracket is indented. By changing
          $cfg['SQP']['fmtInd'] you can change the amount of this indent.
          Related in purpose is $cfg['SQP']['fmtIndUnit'] which specifies
          the units of the indent amount that you specified. This is used
          via stylesheets.

   $cfg['SQP']['fmtColor'] array of string tuples
          This array is used to define the colours for each type of
          element of the pretty-printed SQL queries. The tuple format is
          class => [HTML colour code | empty string]
          If you specify an empty string for the color of a class, it is
          ignored in creating the stylesheet. You should not alter the
          class names, only the colour strings.
          Class name key:

          + comment Applies to all comment sub-classes
          + comment_mysql Comments as "#...\n"

   $cfg['SQLValidator']['use'] boolean
          phpMyAdmin now supports use of the Mimer SQL Validator service,
          as originally published on Slashdot.
          For help in setting up your system to use the service, see the
          FAQ #6.14.

   $cfg['SQLValidator']['username'] string
          $cfg['SQLValidator']['password'] string
          The SOAP service allows you to login with anonymous and any
          password, so we use those by default.. Instead, if you have an
          account with them, you can put your login details here, and it
          will be used in place of the anonymous login.

   $cfg['DBG']['enable'] boolean
          DEVELOPERS ONLY!
          Enable the DBG extension for debugging phpMyAdmin. Required for
          profiling the code.
          For help in setting up your system to this, see the Developers
          section.

   $cfg['DBG']['profile']['enable'] boolean
          DEVELOPERS ONLY!
          Enable profiling support for phpMyAdmin. This will append a
          chunk of data to the end of every page displayed in the main
          window with profiling statistics for that page.
          You may need need to increase the maximum execution time for
          this to complete successfully.

   $cfg['DBG']['profile']['threshold'] float (units in milliseconds)
          DEVELOPERS ONLY!
          When profiling data is displayed, this variable controls the
          threshold of display for any profiling data, based on the
          average time each time has taken. If it is over the threshold
          it is displayed, otherwise it is not displayed. This takes a
          value in milliseconds. In most cases you don't need to edit
          this.

   $cfg['ColumnTypes'] array
          All possible types of a MySQL column. In most cases you don't
          need to edit this.

   $cfg['AttributeTypes'] array
          Possible attributes for fields. In most cases you don't need to
          edit this.

   $cfg['Functions'] array
          A list of functions MySQL supports. In most cases you don't
          need to edit this.

   $cfg['RestrictColumnTypes'] array
          Mapping of column types to meta types used for prefering
          displayed functions. In most cases you don't need to edit this.

   $cfg['RestrictFunctions'] array
          Functions prefered for column meta types as defined in
          $cfg['RestrictColumnTypes']. In most cases you don't need to
          edit this.

   $cfg['DefaultFunctions'] array
          Functions selected by default when insering/changing row,
          Functions are defined for meta types from
          $cfg['RestrictColumnTypes'] and for first_timestamp, which is
          used for first timestamp column in table.

Transformations

   Introduction  -  Usage  -  File structure  -

  [1. Introduction]

   To enable transformations, you have to setup the column_info table and
   the proper directives. Please see the Configuration section on how to
   do so.

   You can apply different transformations to the contents of each field.
   The transformation will take the content of each field and transform
   it with certain rules defined in the selected transformation.

   Say you have a field 'filename' which contains a filename. Normally
   you would see in phpMyAdmin only this filename. Using transformations
   you can transform that filename into a HTML link, so you can click
   inside of the phpMyAdmin structure on the field's link and will see
   the file displayed in a new browser window. Using transformation
   options you can also specify strings to append/prepend to a string or
   the format you want the output stored in.

   For a general overview of all available transformations and their
   options, you can consult your
   <www.your-host.com>/<your-install-dir>/libraries/transformations/overv
   iew.php installation.

   For a tutorial on how to effectively use transformations, see our Link
   section on the official phpMyAdmin-homepage.

  [2. Usage]

   Go to your tbl_properties.inc.php page (i.e. reached through clicking
   on the 'properties' link for a table). There click on "Change" (or
   change icon) and there you will see three new fields at the end of the
   line. They are called 'MIME-type', 'Browser transformation' and
   'Transformation options'.
     * The field 'MIME-type' is a dropdown field. You have the options to
       leave that field empty or to use 'auto' [this feature is not yet
       available]. Please note that transformations are inactive as long
       as no mime-type is selected.
     * The field 'Browser transformation' is a drop-down field. You can
       choose from a hopefully growing amount of pre-defined
       transformations. See below for information on how to build your
       own transformation.
       There are global transformations and mimetype-bound
       transformations. Global transformations can be used for any
       mimetype. They will take the mimetype, if necessary, into regard.
       Mimetype-bound transformations usually only operate on a certain
       mimetype. There are transformations which operate on the main
       mimetype (like 'image'), which will most likely take the subtype
       into regard, and those who only operate on a specific subtype
       (like 'image/jpeg').
       You can use transformations on mimetypes for which the function
       was not defined for. There is no security check for you selected
       the right transformation, so take care of what the output will be
       like.
     * The field 'Transformation options' is a free-type textfield. You
       have to enter transform-function specific options here. Usually
       the transforms can operate with default options, but it is
       generally a good idea to look up the overview to see which options
       are necessary.
       Much like the ENUM/SET-Fields, you have to split up several
       options using the format 'a','b','c',...(NOTE THE MISSING BLANKS).
       This is because internally the options will be parsed as an array,
       leaving the first value the first element in the array, and so
       forth.
       If you want to specify a MIME character set you can define it in
       the transformation_options. You have to put that outside of the
       pre-defined options of the specific mime-transform, as the last
       value of the set. Use the format "'; charset=XXX'". If you use a
       transform, for which you can specify 2 options and you want to
       append a character set, enter "'first parameter','second
       parameter','charset=us-ascii'". You can, however use the defaults
       for the parameters: "'','','charset=us-ascii'".

  [3. File structure]

   All mimetypes and their transformations are defined through single
   files in the directory 'libraries/transformations/'.

   They are stored in files to ease up customization and easy adding of
   new transformations.

   Because the user cannot enter own mimetypes, it is kept sure that
   transformations always work. It makes no sense to apply a
   transformation to a mimetype, the transform-function doesn't know to
   handle.

   One can, however, use empty mime-types and global transformations
   which should work for many mimetypes. You can also use transforms on a
   different mimetype they where built for, but pay attention to option
   usage as well as what the transformation does to your field.

   There is a basic file called 'global.inc.php'. This function can be
   included by any other transform function and provides some basic
   functions.

   There are 5 possible file names:
    1. A mimetype+subtype transform:
       [mimetype]_[subtype]__[transform].inc.php
       Please not that mimetype and subtype are separated via '_', which
       shall not be contained in their names. The transform
       function/filename may contain only characters which cause no
       problems in the file system as well as the PHP function naming
       convention.
       The transform function will the be called
       'PMA_transform_[mimetype]_[subtype]__[transform]()'.
       Example:
       text_html__formatted.inc.php
       PMA_transform_text_html__formatted()
    2. A mimetype (w/o subtype) transform:
       [mimetype]__[transform].inc.php
       Please note that there are no single '_' characters. The transform
       function/filename may contain only characters which cause no
       problems in the file system as well as the PHP function naming
       convention.
       The transform function will the be called
       'PMA_transform_[mimetype]__[transform]()'.
       Example:
       text__formatted.inc.php
       PMA_transform_text__formatted()
    3. A mimetype+subtype without specific transform function
       [mimetype]_[subtype].inc.php
       Please note that there are no '__' characters in the filename. Do
       not use special characters in the filename causing problems with
       the file system.
       No transformation function is defined in the file itself.
       Example:
       text_plain.inc.php
       (No function)
    4. A mimetype (w/o subtype) without specific transform function
       [mimetype].inc.php
       Please note that there are no '_' characters in the filename. Do
       not use special characters in the filename causing problems with
       the file system.
       No transformation function is defined in the file itself.
       Example:
       text.inc.php
       (No function)
    5. A global transform function with no specific mimetype
       global__[transform].inc.php
       The transform function will the be called
       'PMA_transform_global__[transform]()'.
       Example:
       global__formatted
       PMA_transform_global__formatted()

   So generally use '_' to split up mimetype and subtype, and '__' to
   provide a transform function.

   All filenames containing no '__' in themselves are not shown as valid
   transform functions in the dropdown.

   Please see the libraries/transformations/TEMPLATE file for adding your
   own transform function. See the
   libraries/transformations/TEMPLATE_MIMETYPE for adding a mimetype
   without a transform function. Also note the introduction of a function
   description in the language files. For each function a
   $strTransformation_[filename without .inc.php] has to exist.

   You can use the template generator to generate new functions and
   entries in the language file.

   To create a new transform function please see
   libraries/transformations/template_generator.sh. To create a new,
   empty mimetype please see
   libraries/transformations/template_generator_mimetype.sh.

   A transform function always gets passed three variables:
    1. $buffer - Contains the text inside of the column. This is the
       text, you want to transform.
    2. $options - Contains any user-passed options to a transform
       function as an array.
    3. $meta - Contains an object with field information to your column.
       The data is drawn from the output of the mysql_fetch_field()
       function. This means, all object properties described on the
       manual page are available in this variable and can be used to
       transform a field accordingly to unsigned/zerofill/not_null/...
       properties.
       The $meta->mimetype variable contains the original MIME-type of
       the field (i.e. 'text/plain', 'image/jpeg' etc.)

   -  Usage tips  -  Project  -  Security

   Please have a look at our Link section on the official phpMyAdmin
   homepage for in-depth coverage of phpMyAdmin's features and/or
   interface.

  [1. Server]

    [1.1] I'm running PHP 4+ and my server is crashing each time a specific
    action is required or phpMyAdmin sends a blank page or a page full of
    cryptic characters to my browser, what can I do?

   There are some known PHP bugs with output buffering and compression.
   Try to set the $cfg['OBGzip'] directive to FALSE in your
   config.inc.php file and the zlib.output_compression directive to Off
   in your php configuration file.
   Furthermore, we know about such problems connected to the release
   candidates of PHP 4.2.0 (tested with PHP 4.2.0 RC1 to RC4) together
   with MS Internet Explorer. Please upgrade to the release version PHP
   4.2.0.

    [1.2] My Apache server crashes when using phpMyAdmin.

   You should first try the latest versions of Apache (and possibly
   MySQL).
   See also the other FAQ entry about PHP bugs with output buffering.
   If your server keeps crashing, please ask for help in the various
   Apache support groups.

    [1.3] I'm running phpMyAdmin with "cookie" authentication mode under PHP
    4.2.0 or 4.2.1 loaded as an Apache 2+ module but can't enter the script:
    I'm always displayed the login screen.

   This is a known PHP bug (see this bug report) from the official PHP
   bug database. It means there is and won't be any phpMyAdmin fix
   against it because there is no way to code a fix.

    [1.4] Using phpMyAdmin on IIS, I'm displayed the error message: "The
    specified CGI application misbehaved by not returning a complete set of
    HTTP headers...".

   You just forgot to read the install.txt file from the php
   distribution. Have a look at the last message in this bug report from
   the official PHP bug database.

    [1.5] Using phpMyAdmin on IIS, I'm facing crashes and/or many error
    messages with the HTTP or advanced authentication mode.

   This is a known problem with the PHP ISAPI filter: it's not so stable.
   For some more information and complete testings see the messages
   posted by Andr B. aka "djdeluxe76" in this thread from the phpWizard
   forum.
   Please use instead the cookie authentication mode.

    [1.6] I can't use phpMyAdmin on PWS: nothing is displayed!

   This seems to be a PWS bug. Filippo Simoncini found a workaround (at
   this time there is no better fix): remove or comment the DOCTYPE
   declarations (2 lines) from the scripts header.inc.php,
   header_printview.inc.php, index.php, left.php and
   libraries/common.lib.php.

    [1.7] How can I GZip or Bzip a dump or a CSV export. It does not seem to
    work.

   These features are based on the gzencode() and bzcompress() PHP
   functions to be more independent of the platform (Unix/Windows, Safe
   Mode or not, and so on). So, you must have PHP4 >= 4.0.4 and
   Zlib/Bzip2 support (--with-zlib and --with-bz2).
   We faced PHP crashes when trying to download a dump with MS Internet
   Explorer when phpMyAdmin is run with a release candidate of PHP 4.2.0.
   In this case you should switch to the release version of PHP 4.2.0.

    [1.8] I cannot insert a text file in a table, and I get an error about safe
    mode being in effect.

   Your uploaded file is saved by PHP in the "upload dir", as defined in
   php.ini by the variable upload_tmp_dir (usually the system default is
   /tmp).
   We recommend the following setup for Apache servers running in safe
   mode, to enable uploads of files while being reasonably secure:
     * create a separate directory for uploads: mkdir /tmp/php
     * give ownership to the Apache server's user.group: chown
       apache.apache /tmp/php
     * give proper permission: chmod 600 /tmp/php
     * put upload_tmp_dir = /tmp/php in php.ini
     * restart Apache

    [1.9] I'm having troubles when uploading files. In general file uploads
    don't work on my system and uploaded files have a Content-Type: header in
    the first line.

   It's not really phpMyAdmin related but RedHat 7.0. You have a RedHat
   7.0 and you updated your PHP RPM to php-4.0.4pl1-3.i386.rpm, didn't
   you?
   So the problem is that this package has a serious bug that was
   corrected ages ago in PHP (2001-01-28: see PHP's bug tracking system
   for more details). The problem is that the bugged package is still
   available though it was corrected (see RedHat's BugZilla for more
   details).
   So please download the fixed package (4.0.4pl1-9) and the problem
   should go away.
   And that fixes the \r\n problem with file uploads!

    [1.10] I'm having troubles when uploading files with phpMyAdmin running on
    a secure server. My browser is Internet Explorer and I'm using the Apache
    server.

   As suggested by "Rob M" in the phpWizard forum, add this line to your
   httpd.conf:
       SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown
   It seems to clear up many problems between Internet Explorer and SSL.

    [1.11] I get an 'open_basedir restriction' while uploading a file from the
    query box.

   Since version 2.2.4, phpMyAdmin supports servers with open_basedir
   restrictions. Assuming that the restriction allows you to open files
   in the current directory ('.'), all you have to do is create a 'tmp'
   directory under the phpMyAdmin install directory, with permissions 777
   and the same owner as the owner of your phpMyAdmin directory. The
   uploaded files will be moved there, and after execution of your SQL
   commands, removed.

    [1.12] I have lost my MySQL root password, what can I do?

   The MySQL manual explains how to reset the permissions.

    [1.13] I get an error 'No SQL query' when trying to execute a bookmark.

   If PHP does not have read/write access to its upload_tmp_dir, it
   cannot access the uploaded query.

    [1.14] I get an error 'No SQL query' when trying to submit a query from the
    convenient text area.

   Check the post_max_size directive from your PHP configuration file and
   try to increase it.

    [1.15] I have problems with mysql.user field names.

   In older MySQL versions, the User and Password fields were named user
   and password. Please modify your field names to align with current
   standards.

    [1.16] I cannot upload big dump files (memory, http or timeout problems).

   The first things to check (or ask your host provider to check) are the
   values of upload_max_filesize, memory_limit and post_max_size in the
   php.ini configuration file.
   All of these three settings limit the maximum size of data that can be
   submitted and handled by PHP. One user also said that post_max_size
   and memory_limit need to be larger than upload_max_filesize.
   If you get a timeout problem, look at the $cfg['UploadDir'] feature.

    [1.17] Which MySQL versions does phpMyAdmin support?

   All MySQL versions from 3.21 till 4.0 are fully supported. Please note
   that the older your MySQL version is, the more limitations you will
   have to face.
   phpMyAdmin provides experimental support for MySQL 4.1. That means
   that although you can assign character sets to a table or field,
   phpMyAdmin will not recode the data when inserting or extracting it.
   Instead, it will still use the character set you specified for the
   MySQL connection.
   When compiling php, we strongly recommend that you manually link the
   MySQL extension to a MySQL client library of at least the same version
   since the one that is bundled with php 4.x is rather old and might
   cause problems.
   Also, we do not yet support the imporoved MySQL extension (mysqli)
   that comes with php 5. For the moment, the old MySQL extension should
   also work fine here, if compiled correctly.
   MySQL 5.0 and 5.1 are not yet supported.

    [1.18] I'm running MySQL <= 4.0.1 having lower_case_table_names set to 1.
    If I create a new table with a capital letter in its name it is changed to
    lowercase as it should. But if I try to DROP this table MySQL is unable to
    find the corresponding file.

   This is a bug of MySQL <= 4.0.1. Please upgrade to at least
   MySQL 4.0.2 or turn off your lower_case_table_names directive.

    [1.19] I can't run the "display relations" feature because the script seems
    not to know the font face I'm using!

   The "FPDF" library we're using for this feature requires some special
   files to use font faces.
   Please refers to the FPDF manual to build these files.

    [1.20] I receive the error "cannot load MySQL extension, please check PHP
    Configuration".

   To connect to a MySQL server, PHP needs a set of MySQL functions
   called "MySQL extension". This extension may be part of the PHP
   distribution (compiled-in), otherwise it needs to be loaded
   dynamically. Its name is probably mysql.so or php_mysql.dll.
   phpMyAdmin tried to load the extension but failed.
   Usually, the problem is solved by installing a software package called
   "PHP-MySQL" or something similar.

    [1.21] I am running the CGI version of PHP under Unix, and I cannot login
    using cookie auth.

   In php.ini, set mysql.max_links higher than 1.

    [1.22] I don't see the "Location of text file" field, so I cannot upload.

   This is most likely because in php.ini, your file_uploads parameter is
   not set to "on".

    [1.23] I'm running MySQL on a Win32 machine. Each time I create a new table
    the table and field names are changed to lowercase!

   This happens because the MySQL directive lower_case_table_names
   defaults to 1 (ON) in the Win32 version of MySQL. You can change this
   behavior by simply changing the directive to 0 (OFF):
   Just edit your my.ini file that should be located in your Windows
   directory and add the following line to the group [mysqld]:
   set-variable = lower_case_table_names=0
   Next, save the file and restart the MySQL service. You can always
   check the value of this directive using the query
   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'lower_case_table_names';

    [1.24] Some characters are being truncated in my queries, or I get
    characters randomly added. I am running PHP 4.2.3.

   This is a PHP 4.2.3 bug.

    [1.25] I am running Apache with mod_gzip-1.3.26.1a on Windows XP, and I get
    problems, such as undefined variables when I run a SQL query.

   A tip from Jose Fandos: put a comment on the following two lines in
   httpd.conf, like this:
   # mod_gzip_item_include file \.php$
   # mod_gzip_item_include mime "application/x-httpd-php.*"
   as this version of mod_gzip on Apache (Windows) has problems handling
   PHP scripts. Of course you have to restart Apache.

    [1.26] I just installed phpMyAdmin in my document root of IIS but I get the
    error "No input file specified" when trying to run phpMyAdmin.

   This is a permission problem. Right-click on the phpmyadmin folder and
   choose properties. Under the tab Security, click on "Add" and select
   the user "IUSER_machine" from the list. Now set his permissions and it
   should work.

    [1.27] I get empty page when I want to view huge page (eg.
    db_details_structure.php with plenty of tables).

   This is a PHP bug that occur when GZIP output buffering enabled. If
   you turn off it (by $cfg['OBGzip'] = FALSE in config.inc.php), it
   should work. This bug will be fixed in PHP 5.0.0.

    [1.28] My MySQL server sometimes refuses queries and returns the message
    'Errorcode: 13'. What does this mean?

   This can happen due to a MySQL bug when having database / table names
   with upper case characters although lower_case_table_names is set to
   1. To fix this, turn off this directive, convert all database and
   table names to lower case and turn it on again. Alternatively, there's
   a bug-fix available starting with MySQL 3.23.56 / 4.0.11-gamma.

    [1.29] When I create a table or modify a field, I get an error and the
    fields are duplicated.

   It is possible to configure Apache in such a way that PHP has problems
   interpreting .php files.
   The problems occur when two different (and conflicting) set of
   directives are used:
   SetOutputFilter PHP
   SetInputFilter PHP
   &
   AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
   In the case we saw, one set of directives was in
   /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf, while the other set was in
   /etc/httpd/conf/addon-modules/php.conf.
   The recommended way is with AddType, so just comment out the first set
   of lines and restart Apache:
   #SetOutputFilter PHP
   #SetInputFilter PHP
   
    [1.30] I get the error "left.php: Missing hash".

   This problem is known to happen when the server is running Turck
   MMCache but upgrading MMCache to version 2.3.21 solves the problem.

  [2. Configuration]

    [2.1] The error message "Warning: Cannot add header information - headers
    already sent by ..." is displayed, what's the problem?

   Edit your config.inc.php or .php file and ensure there is nothing
   (I.E. no blank lines, no spaces, no characters...) neither before the
   <?php tag at the beginning, neither after the ?> tag at the end.

    [2.2] phpMyAdmin can't connect to MySQL. What's wrong?

   Either there is an error with your PHP setup or your username/password
   is wrong. Try to make a small script which uses mysql_connect and see
   if it works. If it doesn't, it may be you haven't even compiled MySQL
   support into PHP.

    [2.3] The error message "Warning: MySQL Connection Failed: Can't connect to
    local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (111)..." is displayed.
    What can I do?

   For RedHat users, Harald Legner suggests this on the mailing list:
   On my RedHat-Box the socket of MySQL is /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock. In
   your php.ini you will find a line
       mysql.default_socket = /tmp/mysql.sock
   change it to
       mysql.default_socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
   Then restart apache and it will work.
   Here is a fix suggested by Brad Ummer in the phpwizard forum:
     * First, you need to determine what socket is being used by MySQL.
       To do this, telnet to your server and go to the MySQL bin
       directory. In this directory there should be a file named
       mysqladmin. Type ./mysqladmin variables, and this should give you
       a bunch of info about your MySQL server, including the socket
       (/tmp/mysql.sock, for example).
     * Then, you need to tell PHP to use this socket.
       Assuming you are using PHP 3.0.10 or better, you can specify the
       socket to use when you open the connection. To do this in
       phpMyAdmin, you need to complete the socket information in the
       config.inc.php.
       For example: $cfg['Servers'][$i]['socket'] = '/tmp/mysql.sock';
       Please also make sure that the permissions of this file allow to
       be readable by your webserver (i.e. '0755').

   Have also a look at the corresponding section of the MySQL
   documentation.

    [2.4] Nothing is displayed by my browser when I try to run phpMyAdmin, what
    can I do?

   Try to set the $cfg['OBGZip'] directive to FALSE in the phpMyAdmin
   configuration file. It helps sometime.
   Also have a look at your PHP version number: if it contains "4.0b..."
   it means you're running a beta version of PHP. That's not a so good
   idea, please upgrade to a plain revision.

    [2.5] Each time I want to insert or change a record or drop a database or a
    table, an error 404 (page not found) is displayed or, with HTTP or cookie
    authentication, I'm asked to login again. What's wrong?

   Check the value you set for the $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] directive in
   the phpMyAdmin configuration file.

    [2.6] I get an "Access denied for user: 'root@localhost' (Using password:
    YES)"-error when trying to access a MySQL-Server on a host which is
    port-forwarded for my localhost

   When you are using a port on your localhost, which you redirect via
   port-forwarding to another host, MySQL is not resolving the localhost
   as expected.
   Erik Wasser explains: The solution is: if your host is "localhost"
   MySQL (the commandline tool 'mysql' as well) always tries to use the
   socket connection for speeding up things. And that doesn't work in
   this configuration with port forwarding.
   If you enter "127.0.0.1" as hostname, everything is right and MySQL
   uses the TCP connection.

  [3. Known limitations]

    [3.1] When using HTTP authentication, an user who logged out can not
    relogin in with the same nick.

   This is related to the authentication mechanism (protocol) used by
   phpMyAdmin. To bypass this problem: just close all the opened browser
   windows and then go back to phpMyAdmin. You should be able to log in
   again.

    [3.2] When dumping a large table in compressed mode, I get a memory limit
    error or a time limit error.

   Compressed dumps are built in memory and because of this are limited
   to php's memory limit. For GZip/BZip2 exports this can be overcome
   since 2.5.4 using $cfg['CompressOnFly'] (enabled by default). Zip
   exports can not be handled this way, so if you need Zip files for
   larger dump, you have to use another way.

    [3.3] With InnoDB tables, I lose foreign key relationships when I rename or
    alter a table.

   This seems to be a InnoDB bug (fixed in MySQL 3.23.50?).

    [3.4] I am unable to import dumps I created with the mysqldump tool bundled
    with the MySQL server distribution.

   The problem is that mysqldump creates invalid comments like this:
-- MySQL dump 8.22
--
-- Host: localhost Database: database
---------------------------------------------------------
-- Server version 3.23.54

   The invalid part of the code is the horizontal line made of dashes
   that appears once in every dump created with mysqldump. If you want to
   run your dump you have to turn it into valid MySQL. This means, you
   have to add a whitespace after the first to dashes of the line or add
   a # before it:
   -- -------------------------------------------------------
   or
   #---------------------------------------------------------

    [3.5] When using nested folders ($cfg['LeftFrameTableSeparator']) there are
    some multiple hierarchies displayed in a wrong manner?!

   Please note that you should not use the seperating string multiple
   times without any characters between them, or at the beginning/end of
   your table name. If you have to, think about using another
   TableSeparator or disabling that feature

    [3.6] What is currently not supported in phpMyAdmin about InnoDB?

   In Relation view, being able to choose a table in another database, or
   having more than one index field in the foreign key.
   In Query-by-example (Query), automatic generation of the query LEFT
   JOIN from the foreign table.

    [3.7] I have table with many (100+) fields and when I try to browse table I
    get series of errors like "Warning: unable to parse url". How can this be
    fixed?

   Your table neither have a primary key nor an unique one, so we must
   use a long expression to identify this row. This causes problems to
   parse_url function. The workaround is to create a primary or unique
   key.

    [3.8] I cannot use (clickable) HTML-forms in fields where I put a
    MIME-Transformation onto!

   Due to a surrounding form-container (for multi-row delete checkboxes),
   no nested forms can be put inside the table where phpMyAdmin displays
   the results. You can, however, use any form inside of a table if keep
   the parent form-container with the target to tbl_row_delete.php and
   just put your own input-elements inside. If you use a custom submit
   input field, the form will submit itself to the displaying page again,
   where you can validate the $HTTP_POST_VARS in a transformation. For a
   tutorial on how to effectively use transformations, see our Link
   section on the official phpMyAdmin-homepage.

    [3.9] I get error messages when using "--sql_mode=ANSI" for the MySQL
    server

   When MySQL is running in ANSI-compatibility mode, there are some major
   differences in how SQL is structured (see
   http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/ANSI_mode.html). Most important of all,
   the quote-character (") is interpreted as an identifier quote
   character and not as a string quote character, which makes many
   internal phpMyAdmin operations into invalid SQL statements. There is
   no workaround to this behaviour. News to this item will be posted in
   Bug report #816858

    [3.10] Homonyms and no primary key: When the results of a SELECT display
    more that one column with the same value (for example SELECT lastname from
    employees where firstname like 'A%' and two "Smith" values are displayed),
    if I click Edit I cannot be sure that I am editing the intended row.

   Please make sure that your table has a primary key, so that phpMyAdmin
   can use it for the Edit and Delete links.

  [4. ISPs, multi-user installations ]

    [4.1] I'm an ISP. Can I setup one central copy of phpMyAdmin or do I need
    to install it for each customer.

   Since version 2.0.3, you can setup a central copy of phpMyAdmin for
   all your users. The development of this feature was kindly sponsored
   by NetCologne GmbH. This requires a properly setup MySQL user
   management and phpMyAdmin HTTP or cookie authentication. See the
   install section on "Using HTTP authentication".

    [4.2] What's the preferred way of making phpMyAdmin secure against evil
    access.

   This depends on your system.
   If you're running a server which cannot be accessed by other people,
   it's sufficient to use the directory protection bundled with your
   webserver (with Apache you can use .htaccess files, for example).
   If other people have telnet access to your server, you should use
   phpMyAdmin's HTTP authentication feature.
   Suggestions:
     * Your config.inc.php file should be chmod 660.
     * All your phpMyAdmin files should be chown phpmy.apache, where
       phpmy is a user whose password is only known to you, and apache is
       the group under which Apache runs.
     * You should use PHP safe mode, to protect from other users that try
       to include your config.inc.php in their scripts.

    [4.3] I get errors about not being able to include a file in /lang or in
    /libraries.

   Check php.ini, or ask your sysadmin to check it. The include_path must
   contain "." somewhere in it, and open_basedir, if used, must contain
   "." and "./lang" to allow normal operation of phpMyAdmin.

    [4.4] phpMyAdmin always gives "Access denied" when using HTTP
    authentication.

   This could happen for several reasons:
     * $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser'] and/or
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass'] are wrong.
     * The username/password you specify in the login-dialog are invalid.
     * You have already setup a security mechanism for the
       phpMyAdmin-directory, eg. a .htaccess file. This would interfere
       with phpMyAdmin's authentication, so remove it.

    [4.5] Is it possible to let users create their own databases?

   Starting with 2.2.5, in the user management page, you can enter a
   wildcard database name for a user (for example "joe%"), and put the
   privileges you want. For example, adding SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,
   DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER would let a user create/manage
   his/her database(s).

    [4.6] How can I use the Host-based authentication additions?

   If you have existing rules from an old .htaccess file, you can take
   them and add a username between the 'deny'/'allow' and 'from' strings.
   Using the username wildcard of '%' would be a major benefit here if
   your installation is suited to using it. Then you can just add those
   updated lines into the $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules']
   array.
   If you want a pre-made sample, you can try this fragment. It stops the
   'root' user from logging in from any networks other than the private
   network IP blocks.
       //block root from logging in except from the private networks
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['order'] = 'deny,allow';
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules'] = array(
           'deny root from all',
           'allow root from localhost',
           'allow root from 10.0.0.0/8',
           'allow root from 192.168.0.0/16',
           'allow root from 172.16.0.0/12',
           );

    [4.7] Authentication window is displayed more than once, why?

   This happens if you are using a URL to start phpMyAdmin which is
   different than the one set in your $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri']. For
   example, a missing "www", or entering with an IP address while a
   domain name is defined in the config file.

  [5. Browsers or client OS]

    [5.1] I get an out of memory error, and my controls are non-functional,
    when trying to create a table with more than 14 fields.

   We could reproduce this problem only under Win98/98SE. Testing under
   WinNT4 or Win2K, we could easily create more than 60 fields.
   A workaround is to create a smaller number of fields, then come back
   to your table properties and add the other fields.

    [5.2] With Xitami 2.5b4, phpMyAdmin won't process form fields.

   This is not a phpMyAdmin problem but a Xitami known bug: you'll face
   it with each script/website that use forms.
   Upgrade or downgrade your Xitami server.

    [5.3] I have problems dumping tables with Konqueror (phpMyAdmin 2.2.2).

   With Konqueror 2.1.1: plain dumps, zip and GZip dumps work ok, except
   that the proposed file name for the dump is always 'tbl_dump.php'.
   Bzip2 dumps don't seem to work.
   With Konqueror 2.2.1: plain dumps work; zip dumps are placed into the
   user's temporary directory, so they must be moved before closing
   Konqueror, or else they disappear. GZip dumps give an error message.
   Testing needs to be done for Konqueror 2.2.2.

    [5.4] I can't use the cookie authentication mode because Internet Explorer
    never stores the cookies.

   MS Internet Explorer seems to be really buggy about cookies, at least
   till version 6. And thanks to Andrew Zivolup we've traced also a PHP
   4.1.1 bug in this area!
   Then, if you're running PHP 4.1.1, try to upgrade or downgrade... it
   may work!

    [5.5] In Internet Explorer 5.0, I get JavaScript errors when browsing my
    rows.

   Upgrade to at least Internet Explorer 5.5 SP2.

    [5.6] In Internet Explorer 5.0, 5.5 or 6.0, I get an error (like "Page not
    found") when trying to modify a row in a table with many fields, or with a
    text field

   Your table neither have a primary key nor an unique one, so we must
   use a long URL to identify this row. There is a limit on the length of
   the URL in those browsers, and this not happen in Netscape, for
   example. The workaround is to create a primary or unique key, or use
   another browser.

    [5.7] I refresh (reload) my browser, and come back to the welcome page.

   Some browsers support right-clicking into the frame you want to
   refresh, just do this in the right frame.

    [5.8] With Mozilla 0.9.7 I have problems sending a query modified in the
    query box.

   Looks like a Mozilla bug: 0.9.6 was OK. We will keep an eye on future
   Mozilla versions.

    [5.9] With Mozilla 0.9.? to 1.0 and Netscape 7.0-PR1 I can't type a
    whitespace in the SQL-Query edit area: the page scrolls down.

   This is a Mozilla bug (see bug #26882 at BugZilla).

    [5.10] With Netscape 4.75 I get empty rows between each row of data in a
    CSV exported file.

   This is a known Netscape 4.75 bug: it adds some line feeds when
   exporting data in octet-stream mode. Since we can't detect the
   specific Netscape version, we cannot workaround this bug.

    [5.11] Extended-ASCII characters like German umlauts are displayed wrong.

   Please ensure that you have set your browser's character set to the
   one of the language file you have selected on phpMyAdmin's start page.
   Alternatively, you can try the auto detection mode that is supported
   by the recent versions of the most browsers.

    [5.12] Apple OS X: Safari browser changes special characters to "?".

   This issue has been reported by a OS X user, who adds that Chimera,
   Netscape and Mozilla do not have this problem.

    [5.13] With Internet Explorer 5.5 or 6, and HTTP authentication type, I
    cannot manage two servers: I login to the first one, then the other one,
    but if I switch back to the first, I have to login on each operation.

   This is a bug in Internet Explorer, other browsers do not behave this
   way.

    [5.14] Using Opera6, I can manage to get to the authentification, but
    nothing happens after that, only a blank screen.

   Having $cfg['QueryFrameJS'] set to TRUE, this leads to a bug in
   Opera6, because it is not able to interpret frameset definitiions
   written by JavaScript. Please upgrade to Opera7 at least.

  [6. Using phpMyAdmin]

    [6.1] I can't insert new rows into a table / I can't create a table - MySQL
    brings up a SQL-error.

   Examine the SQL error with care. Often the problem is caused by
   specifying a wrong field-type.
   Common errors include:
     * Using VARCHAR without a size argument
     * Using TEXT or BLOB with a size argument

   Also, look at the syntax chapter in the MySQL manual to confirm that
   your syntax is correct.

    [6.2] When I create a table, I click the Index checkbox for 2 fields and
    phpMyAdmin generates only one index with those 2 fields.

   In phpMyAdmin 2.2.0 and 2.2.1, this is the way to create a
   multi-fields index. If you want two indexes, create the first one when
   creating the table, save, then display the table properties and click
   the Index link to create the other index.

    [6.3] How can I insert a null value into my table?

   Since version 2.2.3, you have a checkbox for each field that can be
   null. Before 2.2.3, you had to enter "null", without the quotes, as
   the field's value. Since version 2.5.5, you have to use the checkbox
   to get a real NULL value, so if you enter "NULL" this means you want a
   literal NULL in the field, and not a NULL value (this works in PHP4).

    [6.4] How can I backup my database or table?

   Click on a database or table name in the left frame, the properties
   will be displayed. Then on the menu, click "Export", you can dump the
   structure, the data, or both. This will generate standard SQL
   statements that can be used to recreate your database/table.
   You will need to choose "Save as file", so that phpMyAdmin can
   transmit the resulting dump to your station. Depending on your PHP
   configuration, you will see options to compress the dump. See also the
   $cfg['ExecTimeLimit'] configuration variable.
   For additional help on this subject, look for the word "dump" in this
   document.

    [6.5] How can I restore (upload) my database or table using a dump? How can
    I run a ".sql" file.

   Click on a database name in the left frame, the properties will be
   local displayed. Then in the "Run SQL query" section, type in your
   dump filename, or use the Browse button. Then click Go.
   For additional help on this subject, look for the word "upload" in
   this document.

    [6.6] How can I use the relation table in Query-by-example?

   Here is an example with the tables persons, towns and countries, all
   located in the database mydb. If you don't have a pma_relation table,
   create it as explained in the configuration section. Then create the
   example tables:
        CREATE TABLE REL_countries (
          country_code char(1) NOT NULL default '',
          description varchar(10) NOT NULL default '',
          PRIMARY KEY (country_code)
        ) TYPE=MyISAM;
        INSERT INTO REL_countries VALUES ('C', 'Canada');
        CREATE TABLE REL_persons (
          id tinyint(4) NOT NULL auto_increment,
          person_name varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
          town_code varchar(5) default '0',
          country_code char(1) NOT NULL default '',
          PRIMARY KEY (id)
        ) TYPE=MyISAM;
        INSERT INTO REL_persons VALUES (11, 'Marc', 'S', '');
        INSERT INTO REL_persons VALUES (15, 'Paul', 'S', 'C');
        CREATE TABLE REL_towns (
          town_code varchar(5) NOT NULL default '0',
          description varchar(30) NOT NULL default '',
          PRIMARY KEY (town_code)
        ) TYPE=MyISAM;
        INSERT INTO REL_towns VALUES ('S', 'Sherbrooke');
        INSERT INTO REL_towns VALUES ('M', 'Montral');
   To setup appropriate links and display information:
     * on table "REL_persons" click Structure, then Relation view
     * in Links, for "town_code" choose "REL_towns->code"
     * in Links, for "country_code" choose "REL_countries->country_code"
     * on table "REL_towns" click Structure, then Relation view
     * in "Choose field to display", choose "description"
     * repeat the two previous steps for table "REL_countries"

   Then test like this:
     * Click on your db name in the left frame
     * Choose "Query"
     * Use tables: persons, towns, countries
     * Click "Update query"
     * In the fields row, choose persons.person_name and click the "Show"
       tickbox
     * Do the same for towns.description and countries.descriptions in
       the other 2 columns
     * Click "Update query" and you will see in the query box that the
       correct joins have been generated
     * Click "Submit query"

    [6.7] How can I use the "display field" feature?

   Starting from the previous example, create the pma_table_info as
   explained in the configuration section, then browse your persons
   table, and move the mouse over a town code or country code.
   See also FAQ 6.21 for an additionnal feature that "display field"
   enables: drop-down list of possible values.

    [6.8] How can I produce a PDF schema of my database?

   First you have to fill the "relation", "table_coords" and "pdf_pages"
   configuration variables.
   Then, think about your schema layout: which tables will go on which
   pages.
     * Click on your db name in the left frame
     * Choose "Structure" in the navigation on top
     * Choose "Edit PDF Pages" which should be somewhere at the bottom of
       the page
     * Enter the name for a first pdf page and submit (you can also use
       the "Automatic layout", which will place on your page all the
       tables that are linked)
     * Choose this page to edit
     * Now add a table you want to show on this page and its coordinates
       and submit
       First you will have to guess those coordinates of course, so just
       expect to have an area of about 297 * 210 and put the tables
       coordinates somewhere in there, you will be able to have a look at
       what happened and change them later.
       For example, x=100 and y=200 means that the table will be at 200
       mm down and 100 mm right from the upper left corner.
       Actually if you have a width of more than 300 or a height of more
       than 200 then it will automatically be scaled but 200*100 is a
       good start to have an idea of what coordinates to use.
     * There is also a visual editor (scratchboard) available, see the
       explanation at the $cfg['WYSIWYG-PDF'] section.
     * After every table you submitted you will have the possibility to
       submit more tables
     * When you have entered enough tables Click on your db name in the
       left frame again
     * Now, again at the bottom of the page you should be able to choose
       "Display PDF schema"
       For testing it might be useful to show the grid as well, so you
       can see the coordinates used.
       Maybe also choose color and submit.
     * Save the file he will offer you to something like Schema.pdf
       (Internet Explorer has some bug there which might make it offer it
       without an extension. Under Windows it is important to have the
       extension ".pdf", under other OSes you should be fine just saving
       the file under the name it offers).

    [6.9] phpMyAdmin is changing the type of one of my columns!

   No, it's MySQL that is doing silent column type changing.

    [6.10] When creating a privilege, what happens with underscores in the
    database name?

   If you do not put a backslash before the underscore, this is a
   wildcard grant, and the underscore means "any character". So, if the
   database name is "john_db", the user would get rights to john1db,
   john2db...
   If you put a backslash before the underscore, it means that the
   database name will have a real underscore.

    [6.11] What is the curious symbol o/ in the statistics pages?

   It means "average".

    [6.12] I want to understand some Export options.

   "Complete inserts" adds the column names on every INSERT command, for
   better documentation (but resulting file is bigger).
   "Extended inserts" provides a shorter dump file by using only once the
   INSERT verb and the table name.
   "Enclose table and field names with backquotes" ensures that field and
   table names formed with special characters are protected.
   "Add AUTO_INCREMENT value" ensures, that AUTO_INCREMENT value (if any)
   will be included in backup.
   "Add into comments" includes column comments, relations and MIME types
   set in the PMA-DB in the dump as SQL comments (/* xxx */).

    [6.13] I would like to create a database with a dot in its name.

   This is a bad idea, because in MySQL the syntax "database.table" is
   the normal way to reference a database and table name. Worse, MySQL
   will usually let you create a database with a dot, but then you cannot
   work with it, nor delete it.

    [6.14] How do I set up the SQL Validator?

   To use it, you need a very recent version of PHP, 4.3.0 recommended,
   with XML, PCRE and PEAR support. On your system command line, run
   "pear install Net_Socket Net_URL HTTP_Request Mail_Mime Net_DIME SOAP"
   to get the necessary PEAR modules for usage.
   If you use it, you should be aware that any SQL statement you submit
   will be stored anonymously (database/table/column names, strings,
   numbers replaced with generic values). The Mimer SQL Validator itself,
   is (c) 2001 Upright Database Technology. We utilize it as free SOAP
   service.

    [6.15] I want to add a BLOB field and put an index on it, but MySQL says
    "BLOB column '...' used in key specification without a key length".

   The right way to do this, is to create the field without any indexes,
   then display the table structure and use the "Create an index" dialog.
   On this page, you will be able to choose your BLOB field, and set a
   size to the index, which is the condition to create an index on a BLOB
   field.

    [6.16] How can I simply move in page with plenty editing fields?

   You can use Ctrl+arrows for moving on most pages with plenty editing
   fields (table structure changes, row editing, etc.) (must be anabled
   in configuration - see. $cfg['CtrlArrowsMoving']). You can also have a
   look at the directive $cfg['DefaultPropDisplay'] ('vertical') and see
   if this eases up editing for you.

    [6.17] Transformations: I can't enter my own mimetype! WTF is this feature
    then useful for?

   Slow down :). Defining mimetypes is of no use, if you can't put
   transformations on them. Otherwise you could just put a comment on the
   field. Because entering your own mimetype will cause serious syntax
   checking issues and validation, this introduces a high-risk
   false-user-input situation. Instead you have to initialize mimetypes
   using functions or empty mimetype definitions.
   Plus, you have a whole overview of available mimetypes. Who knows all
   those mimetypes by heart so he/she can enter it at will?

    [6.18] Bookmarks: Where can I store bookmarks? Why can't I see any
    bookmarks below the query box? What is this variable for?

   Any query you have executed can be stored as a bookmark on the page
   where the results are displayed. You will find a button labeled
   'Bookmark this query' just at the end of the page.
   As soon as you have stored a bookmark, it is related to the database
   you run the query on. You can now access a bookmark dropdown on each
   page, the query box appears on for that database.
   Since phpMyAdmin 2.5.0 you are also able to store variables for the
   bookmarks. Just use the string /*[VARIABLE]*/ anywhere in your query.
   Everything which is put into the value input box on the query box page
   will replace the string "/*[VARIABLE]*/" in your stored query. Just be
   aware of that you HAVE to create a valid query, otherwise your query
   won't be even able to be stored in the database.
   Also remember, that everything else inside the /*[VARIABLE]*/ string
   for your query will remain the way it is, but will be stripped of the
   /**/ chars. So you can use:
   /*, [VARIABLE] AS myname */
   which will be expanded to
   , VARIABLE as myname
   in your query, where VARIABLE is the string you entered in the input
   box. If an empty string is provided, no replacements are made.
   A more complex example. Say you have stored this query:
   SELECT Name, Address FROM addresses WHERE 1 /* AND Name LIKE
   '%[VARIABLE]%' */
   Say, you now enter "phpMyAdmin" as the variable for the stored query,
   the full query will be:
   SELECT Name, Address FROM addresses WHERE 1 AND Name LIKE
   '%phpMyAdmin%'
   You can use multiple occurences of /*[VARIABLE]*/ in a single query.
   NOTE THE ABSENCE OF SPACES inside the "/**/" construct. Any spaces
   inserted there will be later also inserted as spaces in your query and
   may lead to unexpected results especially when using the variable
   expansion inside of a "LIKE ''" expression.
   Your initial query which is going to be stored as a bookmark has to
   yield at least one result row so you can store the bookmark. You may
   have that to work around using well positioned "/**/" comments.
   Variable expansion with PHP-Versions prior to 4.0.3 may not work as
   expected due to a necessary extra-space after any [VARIABLE] usage

    [6.19] How can I create simple LaTeX document to include exported table?

   You can simply include table in your LaTeX documents, minimal sample
   document should look like following one (assuming you have table
   exported in file table.tex):
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{longtable}

\begin{document}

\include{table}

\end{document}

    [6.20] In MySQL 4, I see a lot of databases which are not mine, and cannot
    access them.

   Upgrading to MySQL 4 usually gives users those global privileges:
   CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, SHOW DATABASES, LOCK TABLES. Those privileges
   also enables users to see all the database names, until you upgrade
   the grant tables as described in the MySQL manual, section 2.5.6. See
   this bug report.
   So if your users do not need those privileges, you can remove them and
   their databases list will shorten.

    [6.21] In edit/insert mode, how can I see a list of possible values for a
    field, based on some foreign table?

   You have to setup appropriate links between the tables, and also setup
   the "display field" in the foreign table. See FAQ 6.6 for an example.
   Then, if there are 200 values or less in the foreign table, a
   drop-down list of values will be available. For 200 values or more, a
   distinct window will appear, to browse foreign key values and choose
   one.
   You will see two lists of values, the first list containing the key
   and the display field, the second list containing the display field
   and the key. The reason for this is to be able to type the first
   letter of either the key or the display field.

  [7. phpMyAdmin project]

    [7.1] I have found a bug. How do I inform developers?

   Our Bug Tracker is located at
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/ under the Bugs section.
   But please first discuss your bug with other users:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/ (and choose Forums)

    [7.2] I want to translate the messages to a new language or upgrade an
    existing language, where do I start?

   Always use the current CVS version of your language file. For a new
   language, start from english-iso-8859-1.inc.php. If you don't know how
   to get the CVS version, please ask one of the developers.
   Please note that we try not to use HTML entities like &eacute; in the
   translations, since we define the right character set in the file.
   With HTML entities, the text on JavaScript messages would not display
   correctly. However there are some entities that need to be there, for
   quotes ,non-breakable spaces, ampersands, less than, greater than.
   You can then put your translations, as a zip file to avoid losing
   special characters, on the sourceforge.net translation tracker.
   It would be a good idea to subscribe to the phpmyadmin-translators
   mailing list, because this is where we ask for translations of new
   messages.

    [7.3] I would like to help out with the development of phpMyAdmin. How
    should I proceed?

   The following method is preferred for new developers:
    1. fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:
       cvs
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin login
       [Password: simply press the Enter key]
       cvs -z3
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin checkout phpMyAdmin
       [This will create a new sub-directory named phpMyAdmin]
    2. add your stuff
    3. put the modified files (tar'ed and gzip'ed) inside the patch
       tracker of the phpMyAdmin SourceForge account.

   Write access to the CVS tree is granted only to experienced developers
   who have already contributed something useful to phpMyAdmin.
   Also, have a look at the Developers section.

  [8. Security ]

    [8.1] Security alert, dated 2003-06-18.

   Last update of this FAQ: 2003-07-22.
   The phpMyAdmin development team received notice of this security
   alert: http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/325641.
   The team regrets that the author did not communicate with us before
   sending this alert. However, here is our current reply to the points
   mentionned:
     * "Directory transversal attack"
       This problem had been fixed in version 2.5.0, even if the author
       reports the 2.5.2 development version as vulnerable, which we
       could not reproduce.
     * "Remote local file retrieving"
       This is a misleading title, as the author tells in his text: "Note
       that you can't request files ( only dirs )".
     * "Remote internal directory listing"
       It was possible to retrieve the list of phpMyAdmin's directory
       (which we doubt can cause any damage), but we fixed this in the
       2.5.2 version.
     * "XSS and Path disclosures"
       Most of the XSS problems have been fixed in version 2.5.0. The
       rest have been fixed in the 2.5.2 version.
       We believe that the Path disclosures problems have also been fixed
       in version 2.5.2.
     * "Information encoding weakness"
       We believe that an exploit for this weakness would be difficult to
       achieve. However version 2.5.2 now encrypts the password with the
       well-known blowfish algorithm.

Developers Information

   phpMyAdmin is Open Source, so you're invited to contribute to it. Many
   great features have been written by other people and you too can help
   to make phpMyAdmin a useful tool.

   If you're planning to contribute source, please read the following
   information:
     * All files include header.inc.php (layout),
       libraries/common.lib.php (common functions) and config.inc.php.
       All configuration data belongs in config.inc.php. Please keep it
       free from other code.
       Commonly used functions should be added to
       libraries/common.lib.php and more specific ones may be added
       within a library stored into the libraries sub-directory.
     * Obviously, you're free to use whatever coding style you want. But
       please try to keep your code as simple as possible: beginners are
       using phpMyAdmin as an example application.
       As far as possible, we want the scripts to be XHTML1.0 and CSS2
       compliant on one hand, they fit the PEAR coding standards on the
       other hand. Please pay attention to this.
     * Please try to keep up the file-naming conventions. Table-related
       stuff goes to tbl_*.php, db-related code to db_*.php,
       server-related tools to server_*.php and so on.
     * Please don't use verbose strings in your code, instead add the
       string (at least) to english-iso-8859-1.inc.php and print() it
       out.
     * If you want to be really helpful, write an entry for the
       ChangeLog.
     * The DBG extension (PHP Debugger DBG) is now supported by
       phpMyAdmin for developers to better debug and profile their code.
       Please see the $cfg['DBG']* configuration options for more
       information.
       This is in memoriam of the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-107) which
       was lost during its re-entry into Earth's atmosphere and in memory
       of the brave men and women who gave their lives for the people of
       Earth.

Original Credits of Version 2.1.0
---------------------------------

    This work is based on Peter Kuppelwieser's MySQL-Webadmin. It was his idea
    to create a web-based interface to MySQL using PHP3. Although I have not
    used any of his source-code, there are some concepts I've borrowed from
    him. phpMyAdmin was created because Peter told me he wasn't going to
    further develop his (great) tool.
    Thanks go to
    - Amalesh Kempf <ak-lsml_at_living-source.com> who contributed the
      code for the check when dropping a table or database. He also suggested
      that you should be able to specify the primary key on tbl_create.php3. To
      version 1.1.1 he contributed the ldi_*.php3-set (Import text-files) as
      well as a bug-report. Plus many smaller improvements.
    - Jan Legenhausen <jan_at_nrw.net>: He made many of the changes that
      were introduced in 1.3.0 (including quite significant ones like the
      authentication). For 1.4.1 he enhanced the table-dump feature. Plus
      bug-fixes and help.
    - Marc Delisle <DelislMa_at_CollegeSherbrooke.qc.ca> made phpMyAdmin
      language-independent by outsourcing the strings to a separate file. He
      also contributed the French translation.
    - Alexandr Bravo <abravo_at_hq.admiral.ru> who contributed
      tbl_select.php3, a feature to display only some fields from a table.
    - Chris Jackson <chrisj_at_ctel.net> added support for MySQL
      functions in tbl_change.php3. He also added the
      "Query by Example" feature in 2.0.
    - Dave Walton <walton_at_nordicdms.com> added support for multiple
      servers and is a regular contributor for bug-fixes.
    - Gabriel Ash <ga244_at_is8.nyu.edu> contributed the random access
      features for 2.0.6.
    The following people have contributed minor changes, enhancements, bugfixes
    or support for a new language:
    Jim Kraai, Jordi Bruguera, Miquel Obrador, Geert Lund, Thomas Kleemann,
    Alexander Leidinger, Kiko Albiol, Daniel C. Chao, Pavel Piankov,
    Sascha Kettler, Joe Pruett, Renato Lins, Mark Kronsbein, Jannis Hermanns,
    G. Wieggers.

    And thanks to everyone else who sent me email with suggestions, bug-reports
    and or just some feedback.
