Requirements

     * PHP3 or PHP4: phpMyAdmin widely uses the 'str_replace()' php
       function that was added in PHP 3.0.6, but was buggy up until
       PHP 3.0.8. Then you should not run this script with PHP3 < 3.0.8.
       PHP also needs to be compiled with MySQL support;
     * MySQL (tested with 3.21.x, 3.22.x, 3.23.x and 4.0.x);
     * a web-browser (doh!).

Introduction

   phpMyAdmin can manage a whole MySQL-server (needs a super-user) but
   also a single database. To accomplish the latter you'll need a
   properly set up MySQL-user who can read/write only the desired
   database. It's up to you to look up the appropriate part in the MySQL
   manual. Currently phpMyAdmin can:
     * create and drop databases
     * create, copy, drop and alter tables
     * delete, edit and add fields
     * execute any SQL-statement, even batch-queries
     * manage keys on fields
     * load text files into tables
     * create (*) and read dumps of tables
     * export (*) and import data to CSV values
     * administer multiple servers and single databases
     * check referential integrity
     * communicate in more than 38 different languages
       
   (*)  phpMyAdmin can compress (Zip, GZip -RFC 1952- or Bzip2 formats)
   dumps and CSV exports if you use PHP4 >= 4.0.4 with Zlib support
   (--with-zlib) and/or Bzip2 support (--with-bz2).

Installation

   NOTE: phpMyAdmin does not apply any special security methods to the
   MySQL database server. It is still the sysadmin's job to grant
   permissions on the MySQL databases properly.
   
   Warning for Mac users: php seems not to like Mac end of lines
   character ("\r") and Stuffit unstuffs with Mac formats, of course.
   So you'll have to resave as in Bbedit to unix style ALL phpMyAdmin
   scripts before uploading them to your server.
   
   Documentation warning: when you see in this document a .php3 file
   extension, please transpose to .php if you are using a kit with files
   having this extension.
   
   Quick Install:
    1. Use a distribution kit with the files having the extension (.php3
       or .php) depending on the way your web/PHP server interprets those
       extensions.
    2. Untar or unzip the distribution (be sure to unzip the
       subdirectories): tar xzvf phpMyAdmin_x.x.x.tar.gz in your
       webserver's document root.
    3. Open the file config.inc.php3 in your favourite editor and change
       the values for host, user, password and authentication mode to fit
       your environment. Also insert the correct value for
       $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri']. Have a look at [29]Configuration section
       for an explanation of all values.
    4. It is recommended that you protect the directory in which you
       installed phpMyAdmin (unless it's on a closed intranet, or you
       wish to use http or cookie authentication), for example with
       HTTP-AUTH (in a .htaccess file). See the [30]FAQ section for
       additional information.
    5. Open the file <www.your-host.com>/<your-install-dir>/index.php3 in
       your browser. phpMyAdmin should now display a welcome screen and
       your databases, or a login dialog if using http or cookie
       authentication mode.
       
   Upgrading from an older version:
     * Please do not copy your older config.inc.php3 over the new one: it
       may offer new configuration variables, and the new version may
       depend on these for normal behavior. It is suggested instead to
       insert your site values in the new one.
       
   Using authentication modes:
     * Http and cookie authentication modes are recommended in a
       multi-user environment where you want to give users access to
       their own database and don't want them to play around with others.
       Nevertheless be aware that MS Internet Explorer seems to be really
       buggy about cookies, at least till version 6. And php 4.1.1 is
       also a bit buggy in this area!
     * Http and cookie authentication modes are secure: the MySQL
       password does not need to be set in the phpMyAdmin configuration
       file. (except for the "controluser" -see the Configuration
       section-).
       In cookie mode, we send the password in a temporary cookie, so
       most browsers should not store the password in their cookie file.
     * For 'http' and 'cookie' modes, phpMyAdmin needs a controluser that
       has only the SELECT privilege on the mysql.user (all columns
       except "Password"), mysql.db (all columns) & mysql.tables_priv
       (all columns except "Grantor" & "Timestamp") tables.
       You must specify the details for the controluser in the
       config.inc.php3 file under the $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser']&
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass'] settings.
       This example assumes you want to use pma as the controluser and
       pmapass as the controlpass:
       
       GRANT USAGE ON mysql.* TO 'pma'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY
   'pmapass';
   GRANT SELECT (Host, User, Select_priv, Insert_priv, Update_priv,
   Delete_priv, Create_priv, Drop_priv, Reload_priv, Shutdown_priv,
   Process_priv, File_priv, Grant_priv, References_priv, Index_priv,
   Alter_priv) ON mysql.user TO 'pma'@'localhost';
   GRANT SELECT ON mysql.db TO 'pma'@'localhost';
   GRANT SELECT (Host, Db, User, Table_name, Table_priv, Column_priv) ON
   mysql.tables_priv TO 'pma'@'localhost';
   ... and if you want to use the bookmark feature:
       GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE ON <bookmark_db>.<bookmark_table> TO
   'pma'@'localhost';
     * Then each of the true users should be granted of a set of
       privileges on a set of perticular databases but shouldn't have any
       global privileges. For example, to grant the user real_user with
       all privileges on the database user_base:
          GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON user_base.* TO 'real_user'@localhost
       IDENTIFIED BY 'real_password';
       What the user may now do is controlled entirely by the MySQL user
       management system.
       With http or cookie auth mode, you don't need to fill the
       user/password fields inside the $cfg['Servers'] array.
       
   'http' authentication mode:
     * Was called 'advanced' in versions before 2.2.3.
     * Introduced in 1.3.0, it uses Basic HTTP authentication method and
       allows you to login as any valid MySQL user.
     * Is only supported with PHP running as an Apache module, not with
       cgi.
       
   'cookie' authentication mode:
     * You can use this method as a replacement for the http
       authentication (for example, if you're running IIS).
     * Obviously, the user must enable cookies in the browser.
     * With this mode, the use can truly logout of phpMyAdmin and login
       back with the same username.
       
   'config' authentication mode:
     * This mode is the less secure one because it requires you to fill
       the $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] and
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] fields.
       But you don't need to setup a "controluser" here: using the
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['only_db'] might be enough.
       In the ISP FAQ section, there is an entry explaining how to
       protect your configuration file.

Configuration

   Warning for Mac users: php seems not to like Mac end of lines
   character ("\r"). So ensure you choose the option that allows to use
   the *nix end of line character ("\n") in your text editor before
   registering a script you have modified.
   
   All configurable data is placed in config.inc.php3.
   
   $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] string
          Sets here the complete url (with full path) to your phpMyAdmin
          version. E.g.
          http://www.your_web.net/path_to_your_phpMyAdmin_directory/.
          Don't forget the slash at the end of your url. The url must
          contain characters that are valid for a url, and on some
          servers, the path is case-sensitive.
          This setting can be dynamically completed. For example, you can
          try to use such a kind of code:
          
$cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] = (!empty($HTTPS) ? 'https' : 'http') . '://'
                       . $HTTP_HOST . (!empty($SERVER_PORT) ? ':' . $SERVER_POR
T : '')
                       . substr($PHP_SELF, 0, strrpos($PHP_SELF, '/')+1);

    or

$cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] = (!empty($HTTPS) ? 'https' : 'http') . '://'
                       . $SERVER_NAME . (!empty($SERVER_PORT) ? ':' . $SERVER_P
ORT : '')
                       . substr($SCRIPT_NAME, 0, strrpos($SCRIPT_NAME, '/')+1);


   $cfg['Servers'] array
          Since version 1.4.2, phpMyAdmin supports the administration of
          multiple MySQL servers. Therefore, a $cfg['Servers']-array has
          been added which contains the login information for the
          different servers. The first $cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']
          contains the hostname of the first server, the second
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] the hostname of the second server,
          etc. If you have only one server to administer, simply leave
          free the hostname of the other $cfg['Server']-entries.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] string
          The hostname of your $i-th MySQL-server. E.g. localhost.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['port'] string
          The port-number of your $i-th MySQL-server. Default is 3306
          (leave blank).
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['socket'] string
          The path to the socket to use. Leave blank for default.
          To use the socket feature you must run php 3.0.10 or more.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['connect_type'] string
          What type connection to use with the MySQL server. Your options
          are 'socket' & 'tcp'. It defaults to 'tcp' as that is nearly
          guarenteed to be available on all MySQL servers, while sockets
          are not supported on some platforms.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser'] string
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass'] string
          When using http or cookie authentication modes (or 'config'
          authentication mode since phpMyAdmin 2.2.1), you need to supply
          the details of a MySQL account that has SELECT privilege on the
          mysql.user (all columns except "Password"), mysql.db (all
          columns) & mysql.tables_priv (all columns except "Grantor" &
          "Timestamp") tables. This account is used to check what
          databases the user will see at login.
          Please see the [39]install section on "Using http
          authentication" for more information.
          Note that if you try login to phpMyAdmin with this
          "controluser", you could get some errors, depending the exact
          privileges you gave to the "controluser". phpMyAdmin does not
          support a direct login with the "controluser".
          In versions before 2.2.5, those were called "stduser/stdpass".
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] string ['http'|'cookie'|'config']
          Whether config or cookie or http authentication should be used
          for this server.
          
          + 'config' authentication ($auth_type = 'config') is the plain
            old way: username and password are stored in config.inc.php3.
          + 'cookie' authentication mode ($auth_type = 'cookie') as
            introduced in 2.2.3 allows you to log in as any valid MySQL
            user with the help of... cookies. Log name and password are
            stored in cookies during the session and password is deleted
            when it ends.
          + 'http' authentication (was called 'advanced' in older
            versions) ($auth_type = 'http') as introduced in 1.3.0 allows
            you to log in as any valid MySQL user via HTTP-Auth.
            
          Please see the install section on "Using authentication modes"
          for more information.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] string
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] string
          The user/password-pair which phpMyAdmin will use to connect to
          this MySQL-server. This user/password pair is not needed when
          http or cookie authentication is used, and should be empty.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['only_db'] string or array
          If set to a(an array of) database name(s), only this(these)
          database(s) will be shown to the user. Since phpMyAdmin 2.2.1,
          this/these database(s) name(s) may contain MySQL wilcards
          characters ("_" and "%"): if you want to use literal instances
          of these characters, escape them (ie use 'my\_db' and not
          'my_db').
          This setting is an efficient way to lower the server charge
          since the latter does not need to send MySQL requests to build
          the available database list. But it does not replace the
          privileges rules of the MySQL database server. If set, it just
          means only these databases will be displayed but not at all
          other databases can't be used.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['verbose'] string
          Only useful when using phpMyAdmin with multiple server entries.
          If set, this string will be displayed instead of the hostname
          in the pulldown menu on the main page. This can be useful if
          you want to show only certain databases on your system, for
          example.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['bookmarkdb'] string
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['bookmarktable'] string
          Since release 2.2.0 phpMyAdmin allows to bookmark queries. This
          can be useful for queries you often run.
          To use this functionality you have to:
          
          + create a table following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE bookmark (
                   id int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL auto_increment,
                   dbase varchar(255) NOT NULL,
                   user varchar(255) NOT NULL,
                   label varchar(255) NOT NULL,
                   query text NOT NULL,
                   PRIMARY KEY (id)
                 );
          + then complete the two variables
            $cfg['Servers'][$i]['bookmarkdb'] and
            $cfg['Servers'][$i]['bookmarktable'] with the database and
            table names you've choosen so phpMyAdmin will be able to find
            the bookmarks.
            
          Note that controluser must have SELECT, INSERT and DELETE
          privileges on the bookmark table. Here is a query to set up
          those privileges (using "pma" as the controluser:
          GRANT SELECT,INSERT,DELETE ON <bookmarkdb>.<bookmarktable> to
          'pma'@localhost;
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['relation'] string
          Since release 2.2.4 you can describe, in a special 'relation'
          table, which field is a key in another table (a foreign key).
          phpMyAdmin currently uses this to
          
          + make clickable, when you browse the master table, the data
            values that point to the foreign table;
          + display links on the table properties page, to check
            referential integrity (display missing foreign keys) for each
            described key;
          + in query-by-example, create automatic joints (see an example
            in the FAQ, section "Using phpMyAdmin").
            
          The keys can be numeric or character.
          To use this functionality you have to:
          
          + create in the same database a table (for example 'relation')
            following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE `relation` (
                   `master_table` varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
                   `master_field` varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
                   `foreign_table` varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
                   `foreign_field` varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
                   PRIMARY KEY (`master_table`,`master_field`)
                 ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Table Relation';
          + put the relation table name in
            $cfg['Servers'][$i]['relation']
          + then manually fill the relation table with information about
            the keys.
            
          If you created a relation table before release 2.3.0, you can
          upgrade it with those commands, assuming your table name is
          "relation":
               ALTER TABLE relation CHANGE src_table master_table
          VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL
               ALTER TABLE relation CHANGE src_column master_field
          VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL
               ALTER TABLE relation CHANGE dest_table foreign_table
          VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL
               ALTER TABLE relation CHANGE dest_column foreign_field
          VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL
          
   $cfg['ServerDefault'] integer
          If you have more than one server configured, you can set
          $cfg['ServerDefault'] to any one of them to autoconnect to that
          server when phpMyAdmin is started, or set it to 0 to be given a
          list of servers without logging in.
          If you have only one server configured, $cfg['ServerDefault']
          MUST be set to that server.
          
   $cfg['OBGzip'] boolean
          Defines whether to use gzip output buffering for increased
          speed in HTTP transfers.
          
   $cfg['PersistentConnections'] boolean
          Whether persistent connections should be used or not
          (mysql_connect or mysql_pconnect).
          
   $cfg['ExecTimeLimit'] integer [number of seconds]
          Set the number of seconds a script is allowed to run. If
          seconds is set to zero, no time limit is imposed.
          This setting is used while importing/exporting dump files but
          has no effect when PHP is running in safe mode.
          
   $cfg['SkipLockedTables'] boolean
          Mark used tables and make it possible to show databases with
          locked tables (since 3.23.30).
          
   $cfg['ShowSQL'] boolean
          Defines whether sql-queries generated by phpMyAdmin should be
          displayed or not.
          
   $cfg['AllowUserDropDatabase'] boolean
          Defines whether normal users (non-administrator) are allowed to
          delete their own database or not. If set as FALSE, the link
          "Drop Database" will not be shown, and even a "DROP DATABASE
          mydatabase" will be rejected. Quite practical for ISP's with
          many customers.
          
   $cfg['Confirm'] boolean
          Whether a warning ("Are your really sure..") should be
          displayed when you're about to loose data.
          
   $cfg['ShowTooltip'] boolean
          Defines whether to display table comment as tooltip in left
          frame or not.
          
   $cfg['LeftFrameLight'] boolean
          Defines whether to use select-based menu and display only the
          current tables in the left frame (smaller page).
          
   $cfg['ShowMysqlInfo'] boolean
          $cfg['ShowMysqlVars'] boolean
          $cfg['ShowPhpInfo'] boolean
          $cfg['ShowChgPassword'] boolean
          Defines whether to display the "MySQL runtime information",
          "MySQL system variables", "PHP information" and "Change
          password " links or not for simple users at the starting main
          (right) frame. This setting does not check MySQL commands
          entered directly.
          Please note that to block the usage of phpinfo() in scripts,
          you have to put this in your php.ini:
              disable_functions = phpinfo()
          Also note that enabling the "Change password " link has no
          effect with "config" authentication mode: because of the hard
          coded password value in the configuration file, end users can't
          be allowed to change their passwords.
          
   $cfg['LoginCookieRecall'] boolean
          Define whether the previous login should be recalled or not in
          cookie authentication mode.
          
   $cfg['ShowStats'] boolean
          Defines whether to display space usage and statistics about
          databases and tables or not.
          Note that statistics requires at least MySQL 3.23.3 and that,
          at this date, MySQL doesn't return such information for
          Berkeley DB tables.
          
   $cfg['ShowBlob'] boolean
          Defines whether BLOB fields are shown when browsing a table's

          Defines whether an user should be displayed a "show all
          (records)" button in browse mode or not.
          
   $cfg['MaxRows'] integer
          Number of rows displayed when browsing a resultset. If the
          resultset contains more rows, Previous/Next links will be
          shown.
          
   $cfg['Order'] string [DESC|ASC|SMART]
          Defines whether fields are displayed in ascending (ASC) order,
          in descending (DESC) order or in a "smart" (SMART) order -ie
          descending order for fields of type TIME, DATE, DATETIME &
          TIMESTAMP, ascending order else- by default.
          
   $cfg['ProtectBinary'] boolean or string
          Defines whether BLOB or BINARY fields are protected from
          edition when browsing a table's content or not. Valid values
          are:
          - FALSE to allow edition of all fields;
          - blob to allow edition of all fields except BLOBS;
          - all to disallow edition of all BINARY or BLOB fields.
          
   $cfg['ShowFunctionFields'] boolean
          Defines whether MySQL functions fields should be displayed or
          not in edit/insert mode.
          
   $cfg['ZipDump'] boolean
          $cfg['GZipDump'] boolean
          $cfg['BZipDump'] boolean
          Defines whether to allow the use of zip/gzip/bzip compression
          when creating a dump file or not.
          
   $cfg['ManualBaseShort'] string
          If set to an URL which points to the MySQL documentation (on
          short pages), appropriate help links are generated.
          
   $cfg['DefaultLang'] string
          Defines the default language to use, if not browser-defined or
          user-defined.
          See the select_lang.inc.php3 script to know the valid values
          for this setting.
          
   $cfg['Lang'] string
          Force: always use this language (must be defined in the
          select_lang.inc.php3 script).
          
   $cfg['LeftWidth'] integer
          Left frame width in pixel.
          
   $cfg['LeftBgColor'] string [HTML color]
          $cfg['RightBgColor'] string [HTML color]
          The background colors (HTML) used for both the frames.
          
   $cfg['LeftPointerColor'] string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) used for the pointer in the left frame (does
          not work with NS4).

          The size of a table's border.
          
   $cfg['ThBgcolor'] string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) used for table headers.
          
   $cfg['BgcolorOne'] string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) #1 for table rows.
          
   $cfg['BgcolorTwo'] string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) #2 for table rows.
          
   $cfg['BrowsePointerColor'] string [HTML color]
          $cfg['BrowseMarkerColor'] string [HTML color]
          The colors (HTML) uses for the pointer and the marker in browse
          mode (does not work with NS4).
          The former feature highlights the row over which your mouse is
          passing and the latter lets you visually mark/unmark rows by
          clicking on them.
          You can disable both of these features by emptying the
          respective directive.
          
   $cfg['TextareaCols'] integer
          $cfg['TextareaRows'] integer
          Number of columns and rows for the textareas.

          Defines the place where modify and delete links would be put
          when tables contents are displayed (you may have them displayed
          both at the left and at the right). "Left" and "right" are
          parsed as "top" and "bottom" with vertical display mode.
          
   $cfg['DefaultDisplay'] string
          There are 2 display modes: horizontal and vertical. Define
          which one is displayed by default.
          
   $cfg['RepeatCells'] integer
          Repeat the headers every X cells, or 0 to deactivate.
          
   $cfg['ColumnTypes'] array
          All possible types of a MySQL column. In most cases you don't
          need to edit this.

  [Server]
  
   I'm running php 4+ and my server is crashing each time a specific
   action is required or phpMyAdmin sends a blank page or a page full of
   cryptic characters to my browser, what can I do?
   There are some known php bugs with output buffering and compression.
   Try to set the $cfg['OBGzip'] directive to FALSE in your
   config.inc.php or .php3 file and the zlib.output_compression directive
   to Off in your php configuration file.
   Furthermore, we know about such problems connected to the release
   candidates of php 4.2.0 (tested with php 4.2.0 RC1 to RC4) together
   with MS Internet Explorer. Please upgrade to the release version php
   4.2.0.
   
   My Apache server crashes when using phpMyAdmin.
   You should first try the latest versions of Apache (and possibly
   MySQL).
   See also the other FAQ entry about php bugs with output buffering.
   If your server keeps crashing, please ask for help in the various
   Apache support groups.
   
   Using phpMyAdmin on IIS, I'm displayed the error message: "The
   specified CGI application misbehaved by not returning a complete set
   of HTTP headers...."
   You just forgot to read the install.txt file from the php
   distribution. Have a look at the last message in this [55]bug report
   from the official php bug database.
   
   Using phpMyAdmin on IIS, I'm facing crashes and/or many error messages
   with the http or advanced authentication mode.
   This is a known problem with the php ISAPI filter: it's not so stable.
   For some more information and complete testings see the messages
   posted by André B. aka "djdeluxe76" in [56]this thread from the
   phpWizard forum.
   Please use instead the cookie authentication mode.
   
   I can't use phpMyAdmin on PWS: nothing is displayed!
   This seems to be a PWS bug. Filippo Simoncini found a workaroud (at
   this time there is no better fix): remove or comment the DOCTYPE
   declarations (3 lines) from the scripts header.inc.php3, index.php3,
   left.php3 and libraries/common.lib.php3.
   
   How can I GZip or Bzip a dump or a CSV export. It seems to not work?
   These features are based on the gzencode() and bzcompress() php
   functions to be more independent of the platform (Unix/Windows, Safe
   Mode or not, and so on). So, you must have PHP4 >= 4.0.4 and
   Zlib/Bzip2 support (--with-zlib and --with-bz2).
   We faced php crashes when trying to download a dump with MS Internet
   Explorer when phpMyAdmin is run with a release candidate of php 4.2.0.
   In this case you should switch to the release version of php 4.2.0.
   
   I cannot insert a text file in a table, and I get an error about safe
   mode being in effect.
   Your uploaded file is saved by PHP in the "upload dir", as defined in
   php.ini by the variable upload_tmp_dir (usually the system default is
   /tmp).
   We recommend the following setup for Apache servers running in safe
   mode, to enable uploads of files while being reasonably secure:
     * create a separate directory for uploads: mkdir /tmp/php
     * give ownership to the Apache server's user.group: chown
       apache.apache /tmp/php
     * give proper permission: chmod 600 /tmp/php
     * put upload_tmp_dir = /tmp/php in php.ini
     * restart Apache
       
   I'm having troubles when uploading files. In general file uploads
   don't work on my system and uploaded files have a Content-Type: header
   in the first line.
   It's not really phpMyAdmin related but RedHat 7.0. You have a RedHat
   7.0 and you updated your php rpm to php-4.0.4pl1-3.i386.rpm, didn't
   you?
   So the problem is that this package has a serious bug that was
   corrected ages ago in php (2001-01-28: see [57]php's bug tracking
   system for more details). The problem is that the bugged package is
   still available though it was corrected (see [58]redhat's bugzilla for
   more details).
   So please download [59]the fixed package (4.0.4pl1-9) and the problem
   should go away.
   And that fixes the \r\n problem with file uploads!
   
   I'm having troubles when uploading files with phpMyAdmin running on a
   secure server. My browser is Internet Explorer and I'm using the
   Apache server.
   As suggested by "Rob M" in the phpWizard forum, add this line to your
   httpd.conf:
       SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown
   It seems to clear up many problems between IE and SSL.
   
   I get an 'open_basedir restriction' while uploading a file from the
   query box.
   Since version 2.2.4, phpMyAdmin supports servers with open_basedir
   restrictions. Assuming that the restriction allows you to open files
   in the current directory ('.'), all you have to do is create a 'tmp'
   directory under the phpMyAdmin install directory, with permissions 777
   and the same owner as the owner of your phpMyAdmin directory. The
   uploaded files will be moved there, and after execution of your SQL
   commands, removed.
   
   I have lost my MySQL root password, what can I do?
   The MySql manual explains how to [60]reset the permissions.
   
   I get an error 'No SQL query' when trying to execute a bookmark.
   If PHP does not have read/write access to its upload_tmp_dir, it
   cannot access the uploaded query.
   
   I get an error 'No SQL query' when trying to submit a query from the
   convenient text area.
   Check the post_max_size directive from your php configuration file and
   try to increase it.
   
   I have problems with mysql.user field names.
   In older MySQL versions, the User and Password fields were named user
   and password. Please modify your field names to align with current
   standards.
   
   I cannot upload big dump files.
   The first things to check (or ask your host provider to check) are the
   values of upload_max_filesize, memory_limit and post_max_size in the
   php.ini configuration file.
   All of these three settings limit the maximum size of data that can be
   submitted and handled by php.
   
   Does phpMyAdmin support MySQL 4?
   MySQL 4 is not yet fully supported by phpMyAdmin.
   Because of MySQL 4's backwards compatibility you can use phpMyAdmin
   for administering MySQL 4 servers, but phpMyAdmin does not yet support
   its new features. Please notice that in this case it is recommended to
   use php >= 4.1 since older versions of php are not compatible to
   MySQL 4.
   Furthermore, several users reported problems with phpMyAdmin related
   to bugs in MySQL 4. MySQL 4 is still an alpha release and should be
   used for test purposes only!
   
   I'm running MySQL 4.0.1 on a Windows NT machine. Each time I create a
   table the table name is changed to lowercase.
   This seems to be a bug of MySQL 4.0.1 because it also appears when
   using the MySQL commandline. Currently we only know about its
   appearance on Windows NT systems, but it is possible that it appears
   on other systems, too.
   If you encounter this bug together with another OS and/or MySQL
   version or you know how to work around it, please post a message into
   [61]our bug tracker at SourceForge.
   
  [Configuration]
  
   The error message "Warning: Cannot add header information - headers
   already sent by ..." is displayed, what's the problem?
   Edit your config.inc.php or .php3 file and ensure there is nothing (ie
   no blank lines, no spaces, no characters...) neither before the <?php
   tag at the beginning, neither after the ?> tag at the end.
   
   phpMyAdmin can't connect to MySQL. What's wrong?
   Either there is an error with your PHP setup or your username/password
   is wrong. Try to make a small script which uses mysql_connect and see
   if it works. If it doesn't, it may be you haven't even compiled MySQL
   support into PHP.
   
   The error message "Warning: MySQL Connection Failed: Can't connect to
   local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (111)...") is
   displayed. What can I do?
   For RedHat users, Harald Legner suggests this on the mailing list:
   On my RedHat-Box the socket of mysql is /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock. In
   your php.ini you will find a line
       mysql.default_socket = /tmp/mysql.sock
   change it to
       mysql.default_socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
   Then restart apache and it will work.
   Here is a fix suggested by Brad Ummer in the [62]phpwizard forum:
     * First, you need to determine what socket is being used by MySQL.
       To do this, telnet to your server and go to the MySQL bin
       directory. In this directory there should be a file named
       mysqladmin. Type ./mysqladmin variables, and this should give you
       a bunch of info about your MySQL server, including the socket
       (/tmp/mysql.sock, for example).
     * Then, you need to tell PHP to use this socket.
       Assuming you are using PHP 3.0.10 or better, you can specify the
       socket to use when you open the connection. To do this in
       phpMyAdmin, you need to complete the socket information in the
       config.inc.php3.
       For example: $cfg['Servers'][$i]['socket'] = '/tmp/mysql.sock';
       
   Have also a look at the [63]corresponding section of the MySQL
   documentation.
   
   Nothing is displayed by my browser when I try to run phpMyAdmin, what
   can I do?
   Try to set the $cfg['OBGZip'] directive to FALSE in the phpMyAdmin
   configuration file. It helps sometime.
   Also have a look at your php version number: if it contains "4.0b..."
   it means you're running a beta version of PHP. That's not a so good
   idea, please upgrade to a plain revision.
   
   Each time I want to insert or change a record or drop a database or a
   table, an error 404 (page not found) is displayed or, with http or
   cookie authentication, I'm asked to login again. What's wrong?
   Check the value you set for the $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] directive in
   the phpMyAdmin configuration file.
   
  [Known limitations]
  
   When using http authentication, an user who logged out can not relog
   in with the same nick.
   This is related to the authentication mechanism (protocol) used by
   phpMyAdmin. We plan to change it as soon as we may find enough free
   time to do it, but you can bypass this problem: just close all the
   opened browser windows and then go back to phpMyAdmin. You should be
   able to logs in again.
   
   When dumping a large table in compressed mode, I get a memory limit
   error or a time limit error.
   As of version 2.2.4, we build the compressed dump in memory, so large
   tables dumps may hang. The only alternative we can think about (using
   system calls to mysqldump then gzip or bzip2) would not be applicable
   in environments where PHP is in safe mode: access to system programs
   is is limited by the system administrator, and time limit is enforced.
   
  [ISPs, multi-user installations ]
  
   I'm an ISP. Can I setup one central copy of phpMyAdmin or do I need to
   install it for each customer?
   Since version 2.0.3, you can setup a central copy of phpMyAdmin for
   all your users. The development of this feature was kindly sponsored
   by NetCologne GmbH. This requires a properly setup MySQL user
   management and phpMyAdmin http authentication. See the install section
   on "Using http authentication".
   
   What's the preferred way of making phpMyAdmin secure against evil
   access?
   This depends on your system.
   If you're running a server which cannot be accessed by other people,
   it's sufficient to use the directory protection bundled with your
   webserver (with Apache you can use .htaccess files, for example).
   If other people have telnet access to your server, you should use
   phpMyAdmin's http authentication feature.
   Suggestions:
     * Your config.inc.php3 file should be chmod 660.
     * All your phpMyAdmin files should be chown phpmy.apache, where
       phpmy is a user whose password is only known to you, and apache is
       the group under which Apache runs.
     * You should use PHP safe mode, to protect from other users that try
       to include your config.inc.php3 in their scripts.
       
   I get errors about not being able to include a file in /lang or in
   /libraries.
   Check php.ini, or ask your sysadmin to check it. The include_path must
   contain "." somewhere in it, and open_basedir, if used, must contain
   "." and "./lang" to allow normal operation of phpMyAdmin.
   
   phpMyAdmin always gives "Access denied" when using http
   authentication.
   This could happen for several reasons:
     * $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser'] and/or
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass'] are wrong.
     * The username/password you specify in the login-dialog are invalid.
     * You have already setup a security mechanism for the
       phpMyAdmin-directory, eg. a .htaccess file. This would interfere
       with phpMyAdmin's authentication, so remove it.
       
   Is it possible to let users create their own databases?
   Starting with 2.2.5, in the user management page, you can enter a
   wildcard database name for a user, and put the privileges you want.
   For example, adding SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP,
   INDEX, ALTER would let a user create/manage his/her database(s).
   
  [Browsers or client OS]
  
   I get an out of memory error, and my controls are non-functional, when
   trying to create a table with more than 14 fields.
   We could reproduce this problem only under Win98/98SE. Testing under
   WinNT4 or Win2K, we could easily create more than 60 fields.
   A workaround is to create a smaller number of fields, then come back
   to your table properties and add the other fields.
   
   With Xitami 2.5b4, phpMyAdmin won't process form fields.
   This is not a phpMyAdmin problem but a Xitami known bug: you'll face
   it with each script/website that use forms.
   Upgrade or downgrade your Xitami server.
   
   I have problems dumping tables with Konqueror (phpMyAdmin 2.2.2)
   With Konqueror 2.1.1: plain dumps, zip and gzip dumps work ok, except
   that the proposed file name for the dump is always 'tbl_dump.php'.
   Bzip2 dumps don't seem to work.
   With Konqueror 2.2.1: plain dumps work; zip dumps are placed into the
   user's temporary directory, so they must be moved before closing
   Konqueror, or else they disappear. Gzip dumps give an error message.
   Testing needs to be done for Konqueror 2.2.2.
   
   I can't use the cookie authentication mode because Internet Explorer
   never stores the cookies.
   MS Internet Explorer seems to be really buggy about cookies, at least
   till version 6. And thanks to Andrew Zivolup we've traced also a php
   4.1.1 bug in this area!
   Then, If you're running php 4.1.1, try to upgrade or downgrade... it
   may works!
   
   In Internet Explorer 5.0, I get Javascript errors when browsing my
   rows.
   Upgrade to at least Internet Explorer 5.5SP2.
   
   In Internet Explorer 5.0, 5.5 or 6.0, I get an error when trying to
   modify a row in a table with many fields, or with a text field.
   Your table neither have a primary key nor an unique one, so we must
   use a long URL to identify this row. There is a limit on the lenght of
   the URL in those browsers, and this not happen in Netscape, for
   example. The workaround is to create a primary or unique key, or use
   another browser.
   
   I refresh (reload) my browser, and come back to the welcome page.
   Some browsers support right-clicking into the frame you want to
   refresh, just do this in the right frame.
   
   With Mozilla 0.9.7 I have problems sending a query modified in the
   query box.
   Looks like a Mozilla bug: 0.9.6 was ok. We will keep an eye on future
   Mozilla versions.
   
   With Mozilla 0.9.? to 1.0-RC1 I can't type a whitespace in the
   SQL-Query edit area: the page scrolls down.
   This is a Mozilla bug (see bug #26882 at [64]Bugzilla).
   
  [Using phpMyAdmin]
  
   I can't insert new rows into a table - MySQL brings up a SQL-error.
   Examine the SQL error with care. I've found that many programmers
   specifying a wrong field-type.
   Common errors include:
     * Using VARCHAR without a size argument
     * Using TEXT or BLOB with a size argument
       
   Also, look at the syntax chapter in the MySQL manual to confirm that
   your syntax is correct.
   
   When I create a table, I click the Index checkbox for 2 fields and
   phpMyAdmin generates only one index with those 2 fields.
   In phpMyAdmin 2.2.0 and 2.2.1, this is the way to create a
   multi-fields index. If you want two indexes, create the first one when
   creating the table, save, then display the table properties and click
   the Index link to create the other index.
   
   How can I insert a null value into my table?
   Since version 2.2.3, you have a checkbox for each field that can be
   null. Before 2.2.3, you had to enter "null", without the quotes, as
   the field's value.
   
   How can I backup my database or table?
   Click on a database or table name in the left frame, the properties
   will be displayed. Then go to the Dump section, you can dump the
   structure, the data, or both. This will generate standard SQL
   statements that can be used to recreate your database/table.
   You will need to choose "Save as file", so that phpMyAdmin can
   transmit the resulting dump to your station. Depending on your PHP
   configuration, you will see options to compress the dump. See also the
   $cfg['ExecTimeLimit'] configuration variable.
   For additional help on this subject, look for the word "dump" in this
   document.
   
   How can I restore (upload) my database or table using a dump?
   Click on a database name in the left frame, the properties will be

   How can I use the relation table in Query-by-example?
   Here is an example with the tables persons, towns and countries. Start
   by creating this:
        CREATE TABLE countries (
          country_code char(1) NOT NULL default '',
          description varchar(10) NOT NULL default '',
          PRIMARY KEY (country_code)
        ) TYPE=MyISAM;
        INSERT INTO countries VALUES ('C', 'Canada');
        CREATE TABLE persons (
          id tinyint(4) NOT NULL auto_increment,
          person_name varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
          town_code varchar(5) default '0',
          country_code char(1) NOT NULL default '',
          PRIMARY KEY (id)
        ) TYPE=MyISAM;
        INSERT INTO persons VALUES (11, 'Marc', 'S', '');
        INSERT INTO persons VALUES (15, 'Paul', 'S', 'C');
        CREATE TABLE relation (
          master_table varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
          master_field varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
          foreign_table varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
          foreign_field varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
          PRIMARY KEY (master_table,master_field)
        ) TYPE=MyISAM;
        INSERT INTO relation VALUES ('persons', 'town_code', 'towns',
   'town_code');
        INSERT INTO relation VALUES ('persons', 'country_code',
   'countries', 'country_code');
        CREATE TABLE towns (
          town_code varchar(5) NOT NULL default '0',
          description varchar(30) NOT NULL default '',
          PRIMARY KEY (town_code)
        ) TYPE=MyISAM;
        INSERT INTO towns VALUES ('S', 'Sherbrooke');
        INSERT INTO towns VALUES ('M', 'Montréal');
   Then test like this:
     * Click on your db name in the left frame
     * Choose "Query by example"
     * Use tables: persons, towns, countries
     * Click "Update query"
     * In the fields row, choose persons.person_name and click the "Show"
       tickbox
     * Do the same for towns.description and countries.descriptions in
       the other 2 columns
     * Click "Update query" and you will see in the query box that the
       correct joints have been generated
     * Click "Submit query"
       
  [phpMyAdmin project]
  
   I have found a bug. How do I inform developers?
   Our Bug Tracker is located at
   [65]http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/ under the Bugs
   section.
   But please first discuss your bug with other users:
   [66]http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/ (and choose Forums)
   
   I want to translate the messages to a new language or upgrade an
   existing language, where do I start?
   Always use the current cvs version of your language file. For a new
   language, start from english.inc.php3. If you don't know how to get
   the cvs version, please ask one of the developers.
   You can then put your translations, as a zip file to avoid losing
   special characters, on the sourceforge.net translation tracker.
   It would be a good idea to subscribe to the phpmyadmin-translators
   mailing list, because this is where we ask for translations of new
   messages.
   
   I would like to help out with the development of phpMyAdmin. How
   should I proceed?
   The following method is preferred for new developers:
     * fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:
       cvs
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin login
       [Password: simply press the Enter key]
       cvs -z3
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin checkout phpMyAdmin
       [This will create a new sub-directory named phpMyAdmin]
     * add your stuff
     * put the modified files (tar'ed and gzip'ed) inside the patch
       tracker of the [67]phpMyAdmin SourceForge account.
       
   Write access to the CVS tree is granted only to experienced developers
   who have already contributed something useful to phpMyAdmin.
   Also, have a look at the [68]Developers section.

Developers Information

   phpMyAdmin is Open Source, so you're invited to contribute to it. Many
   great features have been written by other people and you too can help
   to make phpMyAdmin a useful tool.
   
   If you're planning to contribute source, please read the following
   information:
     * All files include header.inc.php3 (layout),
       libraries/common.lib.php3 (common functions) and config.inc.php3.
       All configuration data belongs in config.inc.php3. Please keep it
       free from other code.
       Commonly used functions should be added to
       libraries/common.lib.php3 and more specific ones may be added
       within a library stored into the libraries sub-directory.
     * Obviously, you're free to use whatever coding style you want. But
       please try to keep your code as simple as possible: beginners are
       using phpMyAdmin as an example application.
       As far as possible, we want the scripts to be XHTML1.0 and CSS2
       compliant on one hand, they fit [77]PEAR coding standards on the
       other hand. Please pay attention to this.
     * Please try to keep up the file-naming conventions. Table-related
       stuff goes to tbl_*.php3, db-related code to db_*.php3 and so on.
     * Please don't use verbose strings in your code, instead add the
       string (at least) to english.inc.php3 and print() it out.
     * If you want to be really helpful, write an entry for the
       ChangeLog.
       
   IMPORTANT: With 1.4.1, development has switched to CVS. The following
   method is preferred for new developers:
     * fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:
       cvs
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin login
       [Password: simply press the Enter key]
       cvs -z3
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin checkout phpMyAdmin
       [This will create a new sub-directory named phpMyAdmin]
     * add your stuff
     * put the modified files (tar'ed and gzip'ed) inside the patch
       tracker of the phpMyAdmin SourceForge account
       ([78]http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/)
       
   Write access to the CVS tree is granted only to developers who have
   already contributed something useful to phpMyAdmin. If you're
   interested in that, please contact us using the phpmyadmin-devel
   mailing list.

Original Credits of Version 2.1.0
---------------------------------

    This work is based on Peter Kuppelwieser's MySQL-Webadmin. It was his idea
    to create a web-based interface to MySQL using PHP3. Although I have not
    used any of his source-code, there are some concepts I've borrowed from
    him. phpMyAdmin was created because Peter told me he wasn't going to
    further develop his (great) tool.
    Thanks go to
    - Amalesh Kempf <ak-lsml_at_living-source.com> who contributed the
      code for the check when dropping a table or database. He also suggested
      that you should be able to specify the primary key on tbl_create.php3. To
      version 1.1.1 he contributed the ldi_*.php3-set (Import text-files) as
      well as a bug-report. Plus many smaller improvements.
    - Jan Legenhausen <jan_at_nrw.net>: He made many of the changes that
      were introduced in 1.3.0 (including quite significant ones like the
      authentication). For 1.4.1 he enhanced the table-dump feature. Plus
      bug-fixes and help.
    - Marc Delisle <DelislMa_at_CollegeSherbrooke.qc.ca> made phpMyAdmin
      language-independent by outsourcing the strings to a separate file. He
      also contributed the French translation.
    - Alexandr Bravo <abravo_at_hq.admiral.ru> who contributed
      tbl_select.php3, a feature to display only some fields from a table.
    - Chris Jackson <chrisj_at_ctel.net> added support for MySQL
      functions in tbl_change.php3. He also added the
      "Query by Example" feature in 2.0.
    - Dave Walton <walton_at_nordicdms.com> added support for multiple
      servers and is a regular contributor for bug-fixes.
    - Gabriel Ash <ga244_at_is8.nyu.edu> contributed the random access
      features for 2.0.6.
    The following people have contributed minor changes, enhancements, bugfixes
    or support for a new language:
    Jim Kraai, Jordi Bruguera, Miquel Obrador, Geert Lund, Thomas Kleemann,
    Alexander Leidinger, Kiko Albiol, Daniel C. Chao, Pavel Piankov,
    Sascha Kettler, Joe Pruett, Renato Lins, Mark Kronsbein, Jannis Hermanns,
    G. Wieggers.

    And thanks to everyone else who sent me email with suggestions, bug-reports
    and or just some feedback.
