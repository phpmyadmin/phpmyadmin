Requirements

     * PHP3 or PHP4: phpMyAdmin widely uses the 'str_replace()' php
       function that was added in PHP 3.0.6, but was buggy up until
       PHP 3.0.8. Then you should not run this script with PHP3 < 3.0.8.
       PHP also needs to be compiled with mysql and PCRE support;
     * MySQL (tested with 3.21.x, 3.22.x and 3.23.x);
     * a web-browser (doh!).

Introduction

   phpMyAdmin can administer a whole MySQL-server (needs a super-user)
   but also a single database. To accomplish the latter you'll need a
   properly set up MySQL-user who can read/write only the desired
   database. It's up to you to look up the appropiate part in the MySQL
   manual. Currently phpMyAdmin can:
     * create and drop databases
     * create, copy, drop and alter tables
     * delete, edit and add fields
     * execute any SQL-statement, even batch-queries
     * manage keys on fields
     * load text files into tables
     * create (*) and read dumps of tables
     * export (*) and import data to CSV values
     * administer multiple servers and single databases
     * communicate in more than 20 different languages
       
   (*)  phpMyAdmin can compress (GZip format -RFC 1952- or Bzip2) dumps
   and CSV exports if you use PHP4 >= 4.0.4 with Zlib support
   (--with-zlib) and/or Bzip2 support (--with-bz2).

Installation

   Quick Install:
    1. Untar or unzip the distribution (be sure to unzip the
       subdirectories): tar xzvf phpMyAdmin_x.x.x.tar.gz
    2. Open the file config.inc.php3 in your favourite editor and change
       the values for host, user and password to fit your environment.
       Have a look at Documentation.html for an explanation of all
       values.
    3. It is recommended that you protect the directory in which you
       installed phpMyAdmin (unless it's on a closed intranet), for
       example with HTTP-AUTH (in a .htaccess file). See the [30]FAQ
       section for additional information.
    4. Open the file <www.your-host.com>/<your-install-dir>/index.php3 in
       your browser. phpMyAdmin should now display a welcome screen and
       your databases, or a login dialog if using advanced
       authentication.
       
   Upgrading from an older version:
     * Please do not copy your older config.inc.php3 over the new one: it
       may offer new configuration variables, and the new version may
       depend on these for normal behavior. It is suggested instead to
       insert your site values in the new one.

   ______________________________________________________________________
   
Configuration

   All configurable data is placed in config.inc.php3.
   
   $cfgPmaAbsoluteUri string
          Sets here the complete url (with full path) to your phpMyAdmin
          version. E.g.
          http://www.your_web.net/path_to_your_phpMyAdmin_directory/.
          Don't forget the slash at the end of your url.
          
   $cfgServers array
          Since version 1.4.2, phpMyAdmin supports the administration of
          multiple MySQL servers. Therefore, a $cfgServers-array has been
          added which contains the login information for the different
          servers. $cfgServers[1]['host'] contains the hostname of the
          first server, $cfgServers[2]['host'] the hostname of the second
          server, etc. If you have only one server to administer, simply
          leave free the hostname of the other $cfgServer-entries.
          
   $cfgServers[n]['host'] string
          The hostname of your n-th MySQL-server. E.g. localhost.
          
   $cfgServers[n]['port'] string
          The port-number of your n-th MySQL-server. Default is 3306
          (leave blank).
          
   $cfgServers[n]['socket'] string
          The path to the socket to use. Leave blank for default.
          
   $cfgServers[n]['connect_type'] string
          What type connection to use with the MySQL server. Your options
          are 'socket' & 'tcp'. It defaults to 'tcp' as that is nearly
          guarenteed to be available on all MySQL servers, while sockets
          are not supported on some platforms.
          
   $cfgServers[n]['adv_auth'] boolean
          Whether basic or advanced authentication should be used for
          this server.
          Basic authentication ($adv_auth = false) is the plain old way:
          username and password are stored in config.inc.php3. Advanced
          authentication ($adv_auth = true) as introduced in 1.3.0 allows
          you to log in as any valid MySQL user via HTTP-Auth.
          Please note that this authentication mode is only supported
          with PHP running as an Apache module, and not with cgi.
          Using advanced authentication is recommended:
          
          + when phpMyAdmin is running in a multi-user environment where
            people have shell-access that you don't want to know the
            username/password for MySQL.
          + when you want to give users access to their own database and
            don't want them to play around with others.
            
          Advanced authentication is secure as the standard user needs
          just read-only-access to the mysql database. MySQL passwords
          cannot be decrypted easily, so there's no chance for a normal
          user to look at other users' plaintext passwords.
          All you have to provide in config.inc is a standard user which
          can connect to MySQL and read the mysql user/db table (see
          $cfgServers[n]['stduser']).
          See also the FAQ section for more information about security.
          
   $cfgServers[n]['stduser'] string
          $cfgServers[n]['stdpass'] string
          A user/pasword pair used to verify the real user/password pair
          when using advanced authentification. This user must be able to
          connect to MySQL and read the mysql user table.
          Not needed when using basic authentification.
          
   $cfgServers[n]['user'] string
          $cfgServers[n]['password'] string
          The user/password-pair which phpMyAdmin will use to connect to
          this MySQL-server when using basic authentification.
          Not needed when using advanced authentification.
          
   $cfgServers[n]['only_db'] string or array
          If set to a(an array of) database name(s), only this(these)
          database(s) will be shown to the user.
          
   $cfgServers[n]['verbose'] string
          Only useful when using phpMyAdmin with multiple server entries.
          If set, this string will be displayed instead of the hostname
          in the pulldown menu on the main page. This can be useful if
          you want to show only certain databases on your system, for
          example.
          
   $cfgServers[n]['bookmarkdb'] string
          $cfgServers[n]['bookmarktable'] string
          Since release 2.2.0 phpMyAdmin allows to bookmark queries. This
          can be useful for queries you often run.
          To use this functionality you have to:
          
          + create a table following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE bookmark (
                   id int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL auto_increment,
                   dbase varchar(255) NOT NULL,
                   user varchar(255) NOT NULL,
                   label varchar(255) NOT NULL,
                   query text NOT NULL,
                   PRIMARY KEY (id)
                 );
          + then complete the two variables $cfgServers[n]['bookmarkdb']
            and $cfgServers[n]['bookmarktable'] so phpMyAdmin will be
            able to find the bookmark table.
            
          If you are using advanced authentification, stduser must have
          Select_Priv, Insert_Priv and Delete_Priv set to "Y" in mysql.db
          table for the bookmark database.
          
   $cfgServerDefault integer
          If you have more than one server configured, you can set
          $cfgServerDefault to any one of them to autoconnect to that
          server when phpMyAdmin is started, or set it to 0 to be given a
          list of servers without logging in.
          If you have only one server configured, $cfgServerDefault MUST
          be set to that server.
          
   $cfgConfirm boolean
          Whether a warning ("Are your really sure..") should be
          displayed when you're about to loose data.
          
   $cfgPersistentConnections boolean
          Whether persistent connections should be used or not
          (mysql_connect or mysql_pconnect).
          
   $cfgShowBlob boolean
          Defines whether BLOB fields are shown when browsing a table's
          content or not.
          
   $cfgProtectBlob boolean
          Defines whether BLOB fields are protected from edition when
          browsing a table's content or not.
          
   $cfgAllowUserDropDatabase boolean
          Defines whether standard users (non administrator) are allowed
          to delete their own database or not. If set as FALSE, the link
          "Drop Database" will not be shown, and even a "DROP DATABASE
          mydatabase" will be rejected. Quite practical for ISP's with
          many customers.
          
   $cfgShowSQL boolean
          Defines whether sql-queries generated by phpMyAdmin should be
          displayed or not.
          
   $cfgSkipLockedTables boolean
          Mark used tables and make it possible to show databases with
          locked tables (since 3.23.30).
          
   $cfgMaxRows integer
          Number of rows displayed when browsing a resultset. If the
          resultset contains more rows, Previous/Next links will be
          shown.
          
   $cfgOrder string ["DESC"|"ASC"]
          Defines whether fields are displayed in ascending ("ASC") order
          or in descending ("DESC") order when you click on the
          field-name.
          
   $cfgOBGzip boolean
          Defines whether to use gzip output buffering for increased
          speed in HTTP transfers.
          
   $cfgGZipDump boolean
          $cfgBZipDump boolean
          Defines whether to allow the use of gzip/bzip compression when
          creating a dump file or not.
          
   $cfgManualBase string
          If set to an URL which points to the MySQL documentation,
          appropriate help links are generated.
          
   $cfgDefaultLang string
          Defines the default language to use, if not browser-defined or
          user-defined.
          See the select_lang.inc.php3 script to know the valid values
          for this setting.

   $cfgBorder integer
          The size of a table's border.
          
   $cfgThBgcolor string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) used for table headers.
          
   $cfgBgcolorOne string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) #1 for table rows.
          
   $cfgBgcolorTwo string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) #2 for table rows.
          
   $cfgTextareaCols integer
          $cfgTextareaRows integer
          Number of columns and rows for the textareas.

          Maximal number of Chars showed in a field on browse view.
          
   $cfgModifyDeleteAtLeft boolean
          $cfgModifyDeleteAtRight boolean
          Defines the place where modify and delete links would be put
          when tables contents are displayed (you may have them displayed
          both at the left and at the right).
          
   $cfgLeftWidth integer
          Left frame width in pixel.
          
   $cfgColumnTypes array
          All possible types of a MySQL column. In most cases you don't
          need to edit this.

FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

   The error message "Warning: Cannot add header information - headers
   already sent by ..." is displayed, what's the problem?
   Look at the end of your config.inc.php or .php3 file, there must be no
   blank lines or spaces after the ?>.
   
   I can't insert new rows into a table - MySQL brings up a SQL-error.
   Examine the SQL error with care. I've found that many programmers
   specifying a wrong field-type.
   Common errors include:
     * Using VARCHAR without a size argument
     * Using TEXT or BLOB with a size argument
       
   Also, look at the syntax chapter in the MySQL manual to confirm that
   your syntax is correct.
   
   phpMyAdmin can't connect to MySQL. What's wrong?
   Either there is an error with your PHP setup or your username/password
   is wrong. Try to make a small script which uses mysql_connect and see
   if it works. If it doesn't, it may be you haven't even compiled MySQL
   support into PHP.
   
   The error message "Warning: MySQL Connection Failed: Can't connect to
   local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (111)...") is
   displayed. What can I do?
   Here is a fix suggested by Brad Ummer in the [47]phpwizard forum:
     * First, you need to determine what socket is being used by MySQL.
       To do this, telnet to your server and go to the MySQL bin
       directory. In this directory there should be a file named
       mysqladmin. Type ./mysqladmin variables, and this should give you
       a bunch of info about your MySQL server, including the socket
       (/tmp/mysql.sock, for example).
     * Then, you need to tell PHP to use this socket.
       Assuming you are using PHP 3.0.10 or better, you can specify the
       socket to use when you open the connection. To do this in
       phpMyAdmin, you need to complete the socket information in the
       config.inc.php3.
       For example: $cfgServers[n]['socket'] = '/tmp/mysql.sock';
       
   phpMyAdmin always gives "Access denied" when using advanced
   authentification.
   This could happen for some reasons:
     * $stduser/$stdpassword is wrong. Try to turn off $adv_auth and use
       this username and password to connect to MySQL.
     * The username/password your specify in the login-dialog is wrong.
       Try the same as above and see if it works.
     * You have already setup a security mechanism for the
       phpMyAdmin-directory, eg. a .htaccess file. This would interfere
       with phpMyAdmin's authentification, so remove it.
       
   When using advanced authentification, an user who logged out can not
   relogs in with the same nick.
   This is related to the authentification mechanism (protocol) used by
   phpMyAdmin. We plan to change it as soon as we may find enough free
   time to do it, but you can bypass this problem: just close all the
   opened browser windows and then go back to phpMyAdmin. You should be
   able to logs in again.
   
   I would like to help out with the development of phpMyAdmin. How
   should I proceed?
   The following method is preferred for new developers:
     * fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:
       cvs
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin login
       [Password: simply press the Enter key]
       cvs -z3
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin checkout phpMyAdmin
       [This will create a new sub-directory named phpMyAdmin]
     * add your stuff
     * put the modified files (tar'ed and gzip'ed) inside the patch
       tracker of the [48]phpMyAdmin SourceForge account.
       
   Write access to the CVS tree is granted only to experienced developers
   who have already contributed something useful to phpMyAdmin.
   Also, have a look at the [49]Developers section.
   
   What's the preferred way of making phpMyAdmin secure against evil
   access?
   This depends on your system.
   If you're running a server which cannot be accessed by other people,
   it's sufficient to use the directory protection bundled with your
   webserver (with Apache you can use .htaccess files, for example).
   If other people have telnet access to your server, you should use
   phpMyAdmin's advanced authentification feature.
   Suggestions:
     * Your config.inc.php3 file should be chmod 660.
     * All your phpMyAdmin files should be chown phpmy.apache, where
       phpmy is a user whose password is only known to you, and apache is
       the group under which Apache runs.
     * You should use PHP safe mode, to protect from other users that try
       to include your config.inc.php3 in their scripts.
       
   How can I insert a null value into my table?
   Enter "null", without the quotes, as the field's value. This is
   especially useful for Timestamp or AutoIncrement fields.
   
   I'm an ISP. Can I setup one central copy of phpMyAdmin or do I need to
   install it for each customer?
   Since version 2.0.3, you can setup a central copy of phpMyAdmin for
   all your users. The development of this feature was kindly sponsored
   by NetCologne GmbH.
   This requires a properly setup MySQL user management and phpMyAdmin's
   advanced authentication. phpMyAdmin performs these steps, when
   authenticating a user:
    1. Select all entries from the mysql.user table where the
       username/password matches the challenging user. If no rows are
       returned, the authentication has failed. Otherwise, phpMyAdmin
       continues with step 2.
    2. If the user's global Select_Priv is "N" (ie the user is not
       allowed to access all databases), phpMyAdmin searches the mysql.db
       table for entries with Select_Priv = "Y" belonging to the user. If
       no entries are found, the authentication has failed. Otherwise,
       phpMyAdmin shows all databases the user is allowed to view.
       If the user's global Select_Priv is "Y", all databases in the
       system are shown.
       
   This means that you need to add a user to the mysql database as
   following:
   INSERT INTO user (Host, User, Password, Select_priv, Insert_priv,
   Update_priv, Delete_priv, Create_priv, Drop_priv, Reload_priv,
   Shutdown_priv, Process_priv, File_priv, Grant_priv, References_priv,
   Index_priv, Alter_priv) VALUES ('localhost', 'foo', PASSWORD('bar'),
   'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N')
   INSERT INTO db (Host, Db, User, Select_priv, Insert_priv, Update_priv,
   Delete_priv, Create_priv, Drop_priv, Grant_priv, References_priv,
   Index_priv, Alter_priv) VALUES ('localhost', 'foo_db', 'foo', 'Y',
   'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', '', '', '', '')
   Then only the "foo_db" database will be displayed to user "foo".
   
   How can I GZip or Bzip a dump or a CSV export. It seem to not work?
   These features are based on the gzencode() and bzcompress() php
   functions to be more independent of the platform (Unix/Windows, Safe
   Mode or not, and so on). So, you must have PHP4 >= 4.0.4 and
   Zlib/Bzip2 support (--with-zlib and --with-bz2).
   
   I try to insert a text file in a table, and I get:
   Error MySQL said: The file '/tmp/phpkvpp60' must be in the database
   directory or be readable by all
   Your uploaded file is saved by PHP in the "upload dir", as defined in
   php.ini by the variable upload_tmp_dir (usually the system default is
   /tmp). If this directory is not readable by all, the MySQL server
   (which must be running on the same machine) cannot open the file
   (except if running as root, which is not recommended).
   The system administrator can do a "chmod 777 /tmp": then the MySQL
   server will accept to read it. Also, the user must have File
   privilege.
   
   I'm having troubles when uploading files. In general file uploads
   don't work on my system and uploaded files have a Content-Type: header
   in the first line.
   It's not really phpMyAdmin related but RedHat 7.0. You have a RedHat
   7.0 and you updated your php rpm to php-4.0.4pl1-3.i386.rpm, didn't
   you?
   So the problem is that this package has a serious bug that was
   corrected ages ago in php (2001-01-28: see [50]php's bug tracking
   system for more details). The problem is that the bugged package is
   still available though it was corrected (see [51]redhat's bugzilla for
   more details).
   So please download [52]the fixed package and the problem should go
   away.
   And that fixes the \r\n problem with file uploads!
   
   When I create a table, I click the Index checkbox for 2 fields and
   phpMyAdmin generates only one index with those 2 fields.
   In phpMyAdmin 2.2.0, this is the way to create a multi-fields index.
   If you want two indexes, create the first one when creating the table,
   save, then display the table properties and click the Index link to
   create the other index.

Developers Information

   phpMyAdmin is Open Source, so you're invited to contribute to it. Many
   great features have been written by other people and you too can help
   to make phpMyAdmin a useful tool.
   
   If you're planning to contribute source, please read the following
   information:
     * All files include header.inc.php3 (layout), lib.inc.php3 (common
       functions) and config.inc.php3.
       All configuration data belongs in config.inc.php3. Please keep it
       free from other code.
       Commonly used functions should be added to lib.inc.php3.
     * Obviously, you're free to use whatever coding style you want. But
       please try to keep your code as simple as possible: beginners are
       using phpMyAdmin as an example application.
       By the way, we're currently updating all the scripts so they will
       be XHTML1.0 and CSS2 compliant on one hand, they will fit [61]PEAR
       coding standards on the other hand. Please pay attention to this.
     * Please try to keep up the file-naming conventions. Table-related
       stuff goes to tbl_*.php3, db-related code to db_*.php3 and so on.
     * Please don't use verbose strings in your code, instead add the
       string (at least) to english.inc.php3 and print() it out.
     * If you want to be really helpful, write an entry for the
       ChangeLog.
       
   IMPORTANT: With 1.4.1, development has switched to CVS. The following
   method is preferred for new developers:
     * fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:
       cvs
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin login
       [Password: simply press the Enter key]
       cvs -z3
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin checkout phpMyAdmin
       [This will create a new sub-directory named phpMyAdmin]
     * add your stuff
     * put the modified files (tar'ed and gzip'ed) inside the patch
       tracker of the phpMyAdmin SourceForge account
       ([62]http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/)
       
   Write access to the CVS tree is granted only to developers who have
   already contributed something useful to phpMyAdmin. If you're
   interested in that, please contact us using the phpmyadmin-devel
   mailing list.

Original Credits of Version 2.1.0
---------------------------------

    This work is based on Peter Kuppelwieser's MySQL-Webadmin. It was his idea
    to create a web-based interface to MySQL using PHP3. Although I have not
    used any of his source-code, there are some concepts I've borrowed from
    him. phpMyAdmin was created because Peter told me he wasn't going to
    further develop his (great) tool.
    Thanks go to
    - Amalesh Kempf <ak-lsml_at_living-source.com> who contributed the
      code for the check when dropping a table or database. He also suggested
      that you should be able to specify the primary key on tbl_create.php3. To
      version 1.1.1 he contributed the ldi_*.php3-set (Import text-files) as
      well as a bug-report. Plus many smaller improvements.
    - Jan Legenhausen <jan_at_nrw.net>: He made many of the changes that
      were introduced in 1.3.0 (including quite significant ones like the
      authentification). For 1.4.1 he enhanced the table-dump feature. Plus
      bug-fixes and help.
    - Marc Delisle <DelislMa_at_CollegeSherbrooke.qc.ca> made phpMyAdmin
      language-independent by outsourcing the strings to a separate file. He
      also contributed the French translation.
    - Alexandr Bravo <abravo_at_hq.admiral.ru> who contributed
      tbl_select.php3, a feature to display only some fields from a table.
    - Chris Jackson <chrisj_at_ctel.net> added support for MySQL
      functions in tbl_change.php3. He also added the "Query by Example"
      feature in 2.0.
    - Dave Walton <walton_at_nordicdms.com> added support for multiple
      servers and is a regular contributor for bug-fixes.
    - Gabriel Ash <ga244_at_is8.nyu.edu> contributed the random access
      features for 2.0.6.
    The following people have contributed minor changes, enhancements, bugfixes
    or support for a new language:
    Jim Kraai, Jordi Bruguera, Miquel Obrador, Geert Lund, Thomas Kleemann,
    Alexander Leidinger, Kiko Albiol, Daniel C. Chao, Pavel Piankov,
    Sascha Kettler, Joe Pruett, Renato Lins, Mark Kronsbein, Jannis Hermanns,
    G. Wieggers.

    And thanks to everyone else who sent me email with suggestions, bug-reports
    and or just some feedback.
