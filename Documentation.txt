Requirements

     * PHP3 or PHP4: phpMyAdmin widely uses the 'str_replace()' php
       function that was added in PHP 3.0.6, but was buggy up until
       PHP 3.0.8. Then you should not run this script with PHP3 < 3.0.8.
       PHP also needs to be compiled with MySQL support;
     * MySQL (tested with 3.21.x, 3.22.x, 3.23.x and 4.0.x);
     * a web-browser (doh!).

Introduction

   phpMyAdmin can manage a whole MySQL-server (needs a super-user) but
   also a single database. To accomplish the latter you'll need a
   properly set up MySQL-user who can read/write only the desired
   database. It's up to you to look up the appropriate part in the MySQL
   manual. Currently phpMyAdmin can:
     * create and drop databases
     * create, copy, drop and alter tables
     * delete, edit and add fields
     * execute any SQL-statement, even batch-queries
     * manage keys on fields
     * load text files into tables
     * create (*) and read dumps of tables
     * export (*) and import data to CSV values
     * administer multiple servers and single databases
     * check referential integrity
     * create complex queries automatically connecting required tables
     * create PDF graphics of your Database layout
     * communicate in more than 41 different languages
       
   (*)  phpMyAdmin can compress (Zip, GZip -RFC 1952- or Bzip2 formats)
   dumps and CSV exports if you use PHP4 >= 4.0.4 with Zlib support
   (--with-zlib) and/or Bzip2 support (--with-bz2).

Installation

   NOTE: phpMyAdmin does not apply any special security methods to the
   MySQL database server. It is still the sysadmin's job to grant
   permissions on the MySQL databases properly. phpMyAdmin's "Users" page
   can be used for this.
   
   Warning for Mac users:if you are on a MacOS version before OS X,
   Stuffit unstuffs with Mac formats.
   So you'll have to resave as in Bbedit to unix style ALL phpMyAdmin
   scripts before uploading them to your server, as PHP seems not to like
   Mac-style end of lines character ("\r").
   
   Documentation warning: when you see in this document a .php3 file
   extension, please transpose to .php if you are using a kit with files
   having this extension.
   
   Quick Install:
    1. Choose and download a distribution kit with the files having the
       extension (.php3 or .php) depending on the way your web/PHP server
       interprets those extensions.
    2. Untar or unzip the distribution (be sure to unzip the
       subdirectories): tar xzvf phpMyAdmin_x.x.x.tar.gz in your
       webserver's document root. If you don't have direct access to your
       document root, put the files in a directory on your local machine,
       and, after step 3, transfer the directory on your web server
       using, for example, ftp.
    3. Open the file config.inc.php3 in your favourite editor and change
       the values for host, user, password and authentication mode to fit
       your environment. Also insert the correct value for
       $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri']. Have a look at Configuration section for
       an explanation of all values.
    4. It is recommended that you protect the directory in which you
       installed phpMyAdmin (unless it's on a closed intranet, or you
       wish to use http or cookie authentication), for example with
       HTTP-AUTH (in a .htaccess file). See the FAQ section for
       additional information.
    5. Open the file <www.your-host.com>/<your-install-dir>/index.php3 in
       your browser. phpMyAdmin should now display a welcome screen and
       your databases, or a login dialog if using http or cookie
       authentication mode.
       
   Upgrading from an older version:
     * Please do not copy your older config.inc.php3 over the new one: it
       may offer new configuration variables, and the new version may
       depend on these for normal behavior. It is suggested instead to
       insert your site values in the new one.
       
   Using authentication modes:
     * Http and cookie authentication modes are recommended in a
       multi-user environment where you want to give users access to
       their own database and don't want them to play around with others.
       Nevertheless be aware that MS Internet Explorer seems to be really
       buggy about cookies, at least till version 6. And php 4.1.1 is
       also a bit buggy in this area!
     * Http and cookie authentication modes are more secure: the MySQL
       password does not need to be set in the phpMyAdmin configuration
       file (except for the "controluser" -see the Configuration
       section-).
       However, keep in mind that the password travels in plain text,
       unless you are using the https protocol.
       In cookie mode, we send the password in a temporary cookie, so
       most browsers should not store the password in their cookie file.
     * For 'http' and 'cookie' modes, phpMyAdmin needs a controluser that
       has only the SELECT privilege on the mysql.user (all columns
       except "Password"), mysql.db (all columns) & mysql.tables_priv
       (all columns except "Grantor" & "Timestamp") tables.
       You must specify the details for the controluser in the
       config.inc.php3 file under the $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser']&
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass'] settings.
       This example assumes you want to use pma as the controluser and
       pmapass as the controlpass, but this is only an example: use
       something else in your file:
       
       GRANT USAGE ON mysql.* TO 'pma'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY
   'pmapass';
   GRANT SELECT (Host, User, Select_priv, Insert_priv, Update_priv,
   Delete_priv, Create_priv, Drop_priv, Reload_priv, Shutdown_priv,
   Process_priv, File_priv, Grant_priv, References_priv, Index_priv,
   Alter_priv) ON mysql.user TO 'pma'@'localhost';
   GRANT SELECT ON mysql.db TO 'pma'@'localhost';
   GRANT SELECT (Host, Db, User, Table_name, Table_priv, Column_priv) ON
   mysql.tables_priv TO 'pma'@'localhost';
   ... and if you want to use the many new relation and bookmark
   features:
       GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON <pma_db> TO
   'pma'@'localhost'; (this of course requires you to have a special DB
   for phpMyAdmin, the contents will be explained later)
     * Then each of the true users should be granted of a set of
       privileges on a set of particular databases but shouldn't have any
       global privileges. For example, to grant the user real_user with
       all privileges on the database user_base:
          GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON user_base.* TO 'real_user'@localhost
       IDENTIFIED BY 'real_password';
       What the user may now do is controlled entirely by the MySQL user
       management system.
       With http or cookie auth mode, you don't need to fill the
       user/password fields inside the $cfg['Servers'] array.
       
   'http' authentication mode:
     * Was called 'advanced' in versions before 2.2.3.
     * Introduced in 1.3.0, it uses Basic HTTP authentication method and
       allows you to login as any valid MySQL user.
     * Is only supported with PHP running as an Apache module, not with
       cgi.
       
   'cookie' authentication mode:
     * You can use this method as a replacement for the http
       authentication (for example, if you're running IIS).
     * Obviously, the user must enable cookies in the browser.
     * With this mode, the use can truly logout of phpMyAdmin and login
       back with the same username.
       
   'config' authentication mode:
     * This mode is the less secure one because it requires you to fill
       the $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] and
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] fields.
       But you don't need to setup a "controluser" here: using the
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['only_db'] might be enough.
     * In the ISP FAQ section, there is an entry explaining how to
       protect your configuration file.
     * For additional security in this mode, you may wish to consider the
       Host authentication $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['order'] and
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules'] configuration
       directives.

Configuration

   Warning for Mac users: php seems not to like Mac end of lines
   character ("\r"). So ensure you choose the option that allows to use
   the *nix end of line character ("\n") in your text editor before
   registering a script you have modified.
   
   All configurable data is placed in config.inc.php3.
   
   $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] string
          Sets here the complete url (with full path) to your phpMyAdmin
          version. E.g.
          http://www.your_web.net/path_to_your_phpMyAdmin_directory/.
          phpMyAdmin needs this setting, because of requirements of the
          HTTP protocol, explained in RFC2616, section 14.30.
          Don't forget the slash at the end of your url. The url must
          contain characters that are valid for a url, and on some
          servers, the path is case-sensitive.
          Starting with version 2.3.0, you can try to leave this
          parameter empty, because the program tries to auto-detect its
          proper value. Additional details are in the configuration file.
          Alternatively, this setting can be dynamically completed. For
          example, you can try to use such a kind of code:
          
$cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] = (!empty($_SERVER['HTTPS']) ? 'https' : 'http') . '://'
                       . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']
                       . (!empty($_SERVER['SERVER_PORT']) ? ':' . $_SERVER['SER
VER_PORT'] : '')
                       . substr($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], 0, strrpos($_SERVER['PHP_
SELF'], '/')+1);

    or

$cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] = (!empty($_SERVER['HTTPS']) ? 'https' : 'http') . '://'
                       . $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']
                       . (!empty($_SERVER['SERVER_PORT']) ? ':' . $_SERVER['SER
VER_PORT'] : '')
                       . substr($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'], 0, strrpos($_SERVER['S
CRIPT_NAME'], '/')+1);


          Please note that the $_SERVER array doesn't exist in
          PHP < 4.1.0. Try to replace $_SERVER by $HTTP_SERVER_VARS or
          $GLOBALS in this case.
          
   $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri_DisableWarning'] boolean
          By default, when you leave $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] empty, and
          the system detects your absolute URI automatically, we display
          a warning to remind you. If you have tested the automatic
          detection, and it works perfectly for your setup, then you can
          set this variable to squelch the warning.
          
   $cfg['PmaNoRelation_DisableWarning'] boolean
          Starting with version 2.3.0 phpMyAdmin offers a lot of features
          to work with master / foreign - tables. These features require
          the PMA administrator to set up a special database for PMA (see
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']). Its contents and use will be
          explained further down.
          If you tried to set this up and it does not work for you have a
          look on the "Structure" page of one database where you would
          like to use it. You will find a link that will analyze why
          those features have been disabled.
          If you do not want to use those features set this variable to
          TRUE to stop this message from appearing.
          
   $cfg['Servers'] array
          Since version 1.4.2, phpMyAdmin supports the administration of
          multiple MySQL servers. Therefore, a $cfg['Servers']-array has
          been added which contains the login information for the
          different servers. The first $cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']
          contains the hostname of the first server, the second
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] the hostname of the second server,
          etc. If you have only one server to administer, simply leave
          free the hostname of the other $cfg['Server']-entries.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] string
          The hostname of your $i-th MySQL-server. E.g. localhost.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['port'] string
          The port-number of your $i-th MySQL-server. Default is 3306
          (leave blank).
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['socket'] string
          The path to the socket to use. Leave blank for default.
          To use the socket feature you must run php 3.0.10 or more.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['connect_type'] string
          What type connection to use with the MySQL server. Your options
          are 'socket' & 'tcp'. It defaults to 'tcp' as that is nearly
          guarenteed to be available on all MySQL servers, while sockets
          are not supported on some platforms.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser'] string
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass'] string
          When using http or cookie authentication modes (or 'config'
          authentication mode since phpMyAdmin 2.2.1), you need to supply
          the details of a MySQL account that has SELECT privilege on the
          mysql.user (all columns except "Password"), mysql.db (all
          columns) & mysql.tables_priv (all columns except "Grantor" &
          "Timestamp") tables. This account is used to check what
          databases the user will see at login.
          Please see the install section on "Using http authentication"
          for more information.
          Note that if you try login to phpMyAdmin with this
          "controluser", you could get some errors, depending the exact
          privileges you gave to the "controluser". phpMyAdmin does not
          support a direct login with the "controluser".
          In versions before 2.2.5, those were called "stduser/stdpass".
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] string ['http'|'cookie'|'config']
          Whether config or cookie or http authentication should be used
          for this server.
          
          + 'config' authentication ($auth_type = 'config') is the plain
            old way: username and password are stored in config.inc.php3.
          + 'cookie' authentication mode ($auth_type = 'cookie') as
            introduced in 2.2.3 allows you to log in as any valid MySQL
            user with the help of... cookies. Log name and password are
            stored in cookies during the session and password is deleted
            when it ends.
          + 'http' authentication (was called 'advanced' in older
            versions) ($auth_type = 'http') as introduced in 1.3.0 allows
            you to log in as any valid MySQL user via HTTP-Auth.
            
          Please see the install section on "Using authentication modes"
          for more information.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] string
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] string
          The user/password-pair which phpMyAdmin will use to connect to
          this MySQL-server. This user/password pair is not needed when
          http or cookie authentication is used, and should be empty.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['only_db'] string or array
          If set to a(an array of) database name(s), only this(these)
          database(s) will be shown to the user. Since phpMyAdmin 2.2.1,
          this/these database(s) name(s) may contain MySQL wilcards
          characters ("_" and "%"): if you want to use literal instances
          of these characters, escape them (ie use 'my\_db' and not
          'my_db').
          This setting is an efficient way to lower the server charge
          since the latter does not need to send MySQL requests to build
          the available database list. But it does not replace the
          privileges rules of the MySQL database server. If set, it just
          means only these databases will be displayed but not at all
          other databases can't be used.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['verbose'] string
          Only useful when using phpMyAdmin with multiple server entries.
          If set, this string will be displayed instead of the hostname
          in the pulldown menu on the main page. This can be useful if
          you want to show only certain databases on your system, for
          example.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb'] string
          Starting with version 2.3.0 phpMyAdmin offers a lot of features
          to work with master / foreign - tables. To use those as well as
          the bookmark feature you will need to create a new db.
          To use this functionality as superuser create a new database:
          
          + create a new database for phpmyadmin:
              CREATE DATABASE phpmyadmin;
            Note that "controluser" must have SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and
            DELETE privileges on this database. Here is a query to set up
            those privileges (using "phpmyadmin" as the database name,
            and "pma" as the controluser):
              GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON phpmyadmin.* to
            'pma'@'localhost';
            do not give any other user rights on this database.
          + enter the databasename in $cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']
            
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['bookmarktable'] string
          Since release 2.2.0 phpMyAdmin allows to bookmark queries. This
          can be useful for queries you often run.
          To allow the usage of this functionality the superuser has to:
          
          + set up a PMA database as described above
          + within this database create a table following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE `PMA_bookmark` (
                   id int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL auto_increment,
                   dbase varchar(255) NOT NULL,
                   user varchar(255) NOT NULL,
                   label varchar(255) NOT NULL,
                   query text NOT NULL,
                   PRIMARY KEY (id)
                 ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Bookmarks';
          + enter the tablename in $cfg['Servers'][$i]['bookmarktable']
            
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['relation'] string
          Since release 2.2.4 you can describe, in a special 'relation'
          table, which field is a key in another table (a foreign key).
          phpMyAdmin currently uses this to
          
          + make clickable, when you browse the master table, the data
            values that point to the foreign table;
          + display in an optional tooltip the "display field" when
            browsing the master table, if you move the mouse to a column
            containing a foreign key (use also the 'table_info' table);
          + display links on the table properties page, to check
            referential integrity (display missing foreign keys) for each
            described key;
          + in query-by-example, create automatic joins (see an example
            in the FAQ, section "Using phpMyAdmin");
          + enable you to get a PDF schema of your database (also uses
            the table_coords table).
            
          The keys can be numeric or character.
          To allow the usage of this functionality the superuser has to:
          
          + set up a PMA database as described above
          + within this database create a table following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE `PMA_relation` (
                   `master_db` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `master_table` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `master_field` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `foreign_db` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `foreign_table` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `foreign_field` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   PRIMARY KEY (`master_db`, `master_table`,
            `master_field`),
                   KEY foreign_field (foreign_db, foreign_table)
                 ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Relation table';
          + put the relation table name in
            $cfg['Servers'][$i]['relation']
          + now as normal user open phpMyAdmin and for each one of your
            tables where you want to use this feature, click
            "Structure/Relation view/" and choose foreign fields.
            
          Please note that in the current (2.3.0) version, master_db must
          be the same as foreign_db. Those fields have been put in future
          development of the cross-db relations.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_info'] string
          Since release 2.3.0 you can describe, in a special 'table_info'
          table, which field is to be displayed as a tooltip when moving
          the cursor over the corresponding key.
          This configuration variable will hold the name of this special
          table. To allow the usage of this functionality the superuser
          has to:
          
          + set up a PMA database as described above
          + within this database create a table following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE `PMA_table_info` (
                   `db_name` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `table_name` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `display_field` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   PRIMARY KEY (`db_name`, `table_name`)
                 ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Table information for
            phpMyAdmin';
          + put the table name in $cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_info']
          + then for each table where you want to use this feature, click
            "Structure/Relation view/Choose field to display" to choose
            the field.
            
          Usage tip: Display field.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_coords'] string
          $cfg['Servers'][$i]['pdf_pages'] string
          Since release 2.3.0 you can have phpMyAdmin create PDF pages
          showing the relations between your tables. To do this it needs
          two tables "pdf_pages" (storing information about the available
          pdf pages) and "table_coords" (storing coordinates where each
          table will be placed on a PDF schema output).
          You must be using the "relation" feature and have a table of
          PDF pages (see $cfg['Servers'][$i]['pdf_pages']) to create PDF
          output.
          To allow the usage of this functionality the superuser has to:
          
          + set up a PMA database as described above
          + within this database create a table following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE `PMA_table_coords` (
                   `db_name` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `table_name` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `pdf_page_number` int NOT NULL default '0',
                   `x` float unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
                   `y` float unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
                   PRIMARY KEY (`db_name`, `table_name`,
            `pdf_page_number`)
                 ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Table coordinates for phpMyAdmin
            PDF output';
          + also within this database create:
                 CREATE TABLE `PMA_pdf_pages` (
                   `db_name` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   `page_nr` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
                   `page_descr` varchar(50) NOT NULL default '',
                   PRIMARY KEY (page_nr),
                   KEY (db_name)
                 ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='PDF Relationpages for PMA';
          + put the first table name in
            $cfg['Servers'][$i]['table_coords'] and the second table name
            in $cfg['Servers'][$i]['pdf_pages']
            
          Usage tips: PDF output.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['column_comments'] string
          Since release 2.3.0 you can store comments to describe each
          column for each table. These will then be shown on the
          "printview".
          To allow the usage of this functionality the superuser has to:
          
          + set up a PMA database as described above
          + within this database create a table following this scheme:
                 CREATE TABLE `PMA_column_comments` (
                   id int(5) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
                   db_name varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   table_name varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   column_name varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
                   comment varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
                   PRIMARY KEY (id),
                   UNIQUE KEY db_name (db_name, table_name, column_name)
                 ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Comments for Columns';
          + put the table name in $cfg['Servers'][$i]['column_comments']
            
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['order'] string
          If your rule order is empty, then IP authentication is
          disabled.
          If your rule order is set to 'deny,allow' then the system
          applies all deny rules followed by allow rules. Access is
          allowed by default. Any client which does not match a Deny
          command or does match an Allow command will be allowed access
          to the server.
          If your rule order is set to 'allow,deny' then the system
          applies all allow rules followed by deny rules. Access is
          denied by default. Any client which does not match an Allow
          directive or does match a Deny directive will be denied access
          to the server.
          If your rule order is set to 'explicit', the authentication is
          performed in a similar fashion to rule order 'deny,allow', with
          the added restriction that your host/username combination must
          be listed in the allow rules, and not listed in the deny rules.
          This is the most secure means of using Allow/Deny rules, and
          was available in Apache by specifying allow and deny rules
          without setting any order.
          
   $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules'] array of strings
          The general format for the rules is as such:
                <'allow' | 'deny'> <username> [from] <ipmask>
          If you wish to match all users, it is possible to use a '%' as
          a wildcard in the username field.
          There are a few shortcuts you can use in the ipmask field as
          well:
               'all' -> 0.0.0.0/0
               'localhost' -> 127.0.0.1/8
          Having an empty rule list is equivalent to either using 'allow
          % from all' if your rule order is set to 'deny,allow' or 'deny
          % from all' if your rule order is set to 'allow,deny' or
          'explicit'.
          For the IP matching system, the following work:
          xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (an exact IP address)
          xxx.xxx.xxx.[yyy-zzz] (an IP address range)
          xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/nn (CIDR, Classless Inter-Domain Routing type
          IP addresses)
          But the following does not work:
          xxx.xxx.xxx.xx[yyy-zzz] (partial IP address range)
          
   $cfg['ServerDefault'] integer
          If you have more than one server configured, you can set
          $cfg['ServerDefault'] to any one of them to autoconnect to that
          server when phpMyAdmin is started, or set it to 0 to be given a
          list of servers without logging in.
          If you have only one server configured, $cfg['ServerDefault']
          MUST be set to that server.
          
   $cfg['OBGzip'] boolean
          Defines whether to use gzip output buffering for increased
          speed in HTTP transfers.
          
   $cfg['PersistentConnections'] boolean
          Whether persistent connections should be used or not
          (mysql_connect or mysql_pconnect).
          
   $cfg['ExecTimeLimit'] integer [number of seconds]
          Set the number of seconds a script is allowed to run. If
          seconds is set to zero, no time limit is imposed.
          This setting is used while importing/exporting dump files but
          has no effect when PHP is running in safe mode.
          
   $cfg['SkipLockedTables'] boolean
          Mark used tables and make it possible to show databases with
          locked tables (since 3.23.30).
          
   $cfg['ShowSQL'] boolean
          Defines whether sql-queries generated by phpMyAdmin should be
          displayed or not.
          
   $cfg['AllowUserDropDatabase'] boolean
          Defines whether normal users (non-administrator) are allowed to
          delete their own database or not. If set as FALSE, the link
          "Drop Database" will not be shown, and even a "DROP DATABASE
          mydatabase" will be rejected. Quite practical for ISP's with
          many customers.
          
   $cfg['Confirm'] boolean
          Whether a warning ("Are your really sure..") should be
          displayed when you're about to loose data.
          
   $cfg['LoginCookieRecall'] boolean
          Define whether the previous login should be recalled or not in
          cookie authentication mode.
          
   $cfg['UseDbSearch'] boolean
          Define whether the "search string inside database" is enabled
          or not.
          
   $cfg['LeftFrameLight'] boolean
          Defines whether to use select-based menu and display only the
          current tables in the left frame (smaller page).
          
   $cfg['ShowTooltip'] boolean
          Defines whether to display table comment as tooltip in left
          frame or not.
          
   $cfg['ShowStats'] boolean
          Defines whether to display space usage and statistics about
          databases and tables or not.
          Note that statistics requires at least MySQL 3.23.3 and that,
          at this date, MySQL doesn't return such information for
          Berkeley DB tables.
          
   $cfg['ShowMysqlInfo'] boolean
          $cfg['ShowMysqlVars'] boolean
          $cfg['ShowPhpInfo'] boolean
          $cfg['ShowChgPassword'] boolean
          Defines whether to display the "MySQL runtime information",
          "MySQL system variables", "PHP information" and "Change
          password " links or not for simple users at the starting main
          (right) frame. This setting does not check MySQL commands
          entered directly.
          Please note that to block the usage of phpinfo() in scripts,
          you have to put this in your php.ini:
              disable_functions = phpinfo()
          Also note that enabling the "Change password " link has no
          effect with "config" authentication mode: because of the hard
          coded password value in the configuration file, end users can't
          be allowed to change their passwords.
          
   $cfg['SuggestDBName'] boolean
          Defines whether to suggest a database name on the "Create
          Database" form or to keep the textfield empty.
          
   $cfg['ShowBlob'] boolean
          Defines whether BLOB fields are shown when browsing a table's
          content or not.
          
   $cfg['NavigationBarIconic'] boolean
          Defines whether navigation bar buttons contain text or symbols
          only.
          
   $cfg['ShowAll'] boolean
          Defines whether an user should be displayed a "show all
          (records)" button in browse mode or not.
          
   $cfg['MaxRows'] integer
          Number of rows displayed when browsing a resultset. If the
          resultset contains more rows, Previous/Next links will be
          shown.
          
   $cfg['Order'] string [DESC|ASC|SMART]
          Defines whether fields are displayed in ascending (ASC) order,
          in descending (DESC) order or in a "smart" (SMART) order -ie
          descending order for fields of type TIME, DATE, DATETIME &
          TIMESTAMP, ascending order else- by default.
          
   $cfg['ProtectBinary'] boolean or string
          Defines whether BLOB or BINARY fields are protected from
          edition when browsing a table's content or not. Valid values
          are:
          - FALSE to allow edition of all fields;
          - blob to allow edition of all fields except BLOBS;
          - all to disallow edition of all BINARY or BLOB fields.
          
   $cfg['ShowFunctionFields'] boolean
          Defines whether MySQL functions fields should be displayed or
          not in edit/insert mode.
          
   $cfg['CharEditing'] string
          Defines which type of editing controls should be used for CHAR
          and VARCHAR fields. Possible values are:
          
          + input - this allows to limit size of text to size of field in
            MySQL, but has problems with newlines in fields
          + textarea - no problems with newlines in fields, but also no
            length limitations
            
          Default is old behavior so input.
          
   $cfg['ZipDump'] boolean
          $cfg['GZipDump'] boolean
          $cfg['BZipDump'] boolean
          Defines whether to allow the use of zip/gzip/bzip compression
          when creating a dump file or not.
          
   $cfg['DefaultTabDatabase'] string
          Defines the tab displayed by default on database view. Possible
          values: "db_details_structure.php3", "db_details.php3" or
          "db_search.php3".
          
   $cfg['DefaultTabTable'] string
          Defines the tab displayed by default on table view. Possible
          values: "tbl_properties_structure.php3", "tbl_properties.php3",
          "tbl_select.php3" or "tbl_change.php3".
          
   $cfg['MySQLManualBase'] string
          If set to an URL which points to the MySQL documentation (type
          depends on $cfg['MySQLManualType']), appropriate help links are
          generated.
          See MySQL Documentation page for more information about MySQL
          manuals and their types.
          
   $cfg['MySQLManualType'] string
          Type of MySQL documentation:
          
          + old - old style used in phpMyAdmin 2.3.0 and sooner
          + searchable - "Searchable, with user comments"
          + chapters - "HTML, one page per chapter"
          + big - "HTML, all on one page"
          + none - do not show documentation links
            
   $cfg['DefaultLang'] string
          Defines the default language to use, if not browser-defined or
          user-defined.
          See the select_lang.inc.php3 script to know the valid values
          for this setting.
          
   $cfg['Lang'] string
          Force: always use this language (must be defined in the
          select_lang.inc.php3 script).
          
   $cfg['DefaultCharset'] string
          Default charset to use for recoding of MySQL queries. This must
          be enabled and it's described by $cfg['AllowAnywhereRecoding']
          option.
          You can give here any charset which is in
          $cfg['AvailableCharsets'] array and this is just default
          choice, user can select any of them.
          
   $cfg['AllowAnywhereRecoding'] boolean
          Allow charset recoding of MySQL queries. You need recode or
          iconv support (compiled in or module) in php to allow MySQL
          queries recoding and used language file must have it enabled
          (by default only these which are in unicode, just to avoid
          losing some characters).
          
   $cfg['RecodingEngine'] string
          You can select here which functions will be used for charset
          conversion. Possible values are:
          
          + auto - automatically use available one (first is tested
            iconv, then recode)
          + iconv - use iconv or libiconv functions
          + recode - use recode_string function
            
          Default is auto.
          
   $cfg['AvailableCharsets'] array
          Available charsets for MySQL conversion. You can add your own
          (any of supported by recode/iconv) or remove these which you
          don't use. Charsets will be shown in same order as here listed,
          so if you frequently use some of these move them to the top.
          
   $cfg['LeftWidth'] integer
          Left frame width in pixel.
          
   $cfg['LeftBgColor'] string [HTML color]
          $cfg['RightBgColor'] string [HTML color]
          The background colors (HTML) used for both the frames.
          
   $cfg['RightBgImage'] string
          The URI of the background image used for the right frame. It
          can be absolute as well as relative from your phpMyAdmin
          directory.
          
   $cfg['LeftPointerColor'] string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) used for the pointer in the left frame (does
          not work with NS4).
          
   $cfg['Border'] integer
          The size of a table's border.
          
   $cfg['ThBgcolor'] string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) used for table headers.
          
   $cfg['BgcolorOne'] string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) #1 for table rows.
          
   $cfg['BgcolorTwo'] string [HTML color]
          The color (HTML) #2 for table rows.
          
   $cfg['BrowsePointerColor'] string [HTML color]
          $cfg['BrowseMarkerColor'] string [HTML color]
          The colors (HTML) uses for the pointer and the marker in browse
          mode (does not work with NS4).
          The former feature highlights the row over which your mouse is
          passing and the latter lets you visually mark/unmark rows by
          clicking on them.
          You can disable both of these features by emptying the
          respective directive.
          
   $cfg['TextareaCols'] integer
          $cfg['TextareaRows'] integer
          $cfg['CharTextareaCols'] integer
          $cfg['CharTextareaRows'] integer
          Number of columns and rows for the textareas.
          This value will be emphasized (*2) for sql query textareas.
          The Char* values are used for CHAR and VARCHAR editing (if
          configured via $cfg['CharEditing']).
          
   $cfg['TextareaAutoSelect'] boolean
          Defines if the whole textarea of the query box will be selected
          on click.
          
   $cfg['LimitChars'] integer
          Maximal number of Chars showed in a TEXT OR a BLOB field on
          browse view. Can be turned off by a toggle button on the browse
          page.
          
   $cfg['ModifyDeleteAtLeft'] boolean
          $cfg['ModifyDeleteAtRight'] boolean
          Defines the place where modify and delete links would be put
          when tables contents are displayed (you may have them displayed
          both at the left and at the right). "Left" and "right" are
          parsed as "top" and "bottom" with vertical display mode.
          
   $cfg['DefaultDisplay'] string
          There are 2 display modes: horizontal and vertical. Define
          which one is displayed by default.
          
   $cfg['UploadDir'] string
          The name of the directory, ending with a slash, where SQL files
          have been uploaded by other means than phpMyAdmin (for example,
          ftp). Those files are available under a drop-down box when you
          click the database name, then the SQL tab.
          Please note that the file names must have the suffix ".sql".
          This feature is useful when your file is too big to be uploaded
          via HTTP, or when file uploads are disabled in PHP.
          Please note that if PHP is running in safe mode, this directory
          must be owned by the same user as the owner of the phpMyAdmin
          scripts.
          
   $cfg['RepeatCells'] integer
          Repeat the headers every X cells, or 0 to deactivate.
          
   $cfg['SQP']['enable'] boolean
          As of phpMyAdmin 2.3.0, we now have a fully functional SQL
          Parser system. It is enabled by default, as it is used to
          format the SQL queries.
          As of 2.3.1, it will become an integral part of phpMyAdmin, as
          it will analyze certain queries to improve the behavior of
          phpMyAdmin. But as it is very new, and not yet heavily used, we
          offer you an option to turn it off.
          
   $cfg['SQP']['fmtType'] string [html|none]
          The main use of the new SQL Parser is to pretty-print SQL
          queries. By default we use HTML to format the query, but you
          can disable this by setting this varible to 'none'
          
   $cfg['SQP']['fmtInd'] float
          $cfg['SQP']['fmtIndUnit'] string [em|px|pt|ex]
          For the pretty-printing of SQL queries, under some cases the
          part of a query inside a bracket is indented. By changing
          $cfg['SQP']['fmtInd'] you can change the amount of this indent.
          Related in purpose is $cfg['SQP']['fmtIndUnit'] which specifies
          the units of the indent amount that you specified. This is used
          via stylesheets.
          
   $cfg['SQP']['fmtColor'] array of string tuples
          This array is used to define the colours for each type of
          element of the pretty-printed SQL queries. The tuple format is
          class => [HTML colour code | empty string]
          If you specify an empty string for the color of a class, it is
          ignored in creating the stylesheet. You should not alter the
          class names, only the colour strings.
          Class name key:
          
          + comment Applies to all comment sub-classes
          + comment_mysql Comments as "#...\n"
          + comment_ansi Comments as "-- ...\n"
          + comment_c Comments as "/*...*/"
          + digit Applies to all digit sub-classes
          + digit_hex Hexadecimal numbers
          + digit_integer Integer numbers
          + digit_float Floating point numbers
          + punct Applies to all punctuation sub-classes
          + punct_bracket_open_round Opening brackets"("
          + punct_bracket_close_round Closing brackets ")"
          + punct_listsep List item seperator ","
          + punct_qualifier Table/Column Qualifer "."
          + punct_queryend End of query marker ";"
          + alpha Applies to all alphabetic classes
          + alpha_columnType Identifers matching a column type
          + alpha_columnAttrib Identifers matching a
            database/table/column attribute
          + alpha_functionName Identifiers matching a MySQL function name
          + alpha_reservedWord Identifiers matching any other reserved
            word
          + alpha_variable Identifers matching a SQL variable "@foo"
          + alpha_identifier All other identifiers
          + quote Applies to all quotation mark classes
          + quote_double Double quotes "
          + quote_single Single quotes '
          + quote_backtick Backtick quotes `
            
   $cfg['SQLValidator']['use'] boolean
          phpMyAdmin now supports use of the Mimer SQL Validator service,
          as originally published on Slashdot.
          For help in setting up your system to use the service, see the
          FAQ #6.14.
          
   $cfg['SQLValidator']['username'] string
          $cfg['SQLValidator']['password'] string
          The SOAP service allows you to login with anonymous and any
          password, so we use those by default.. Instead, if you have an
          account with them, you can put your login details here, and it
          will be used in place of the anonymous login.
          
   $cfg['ColumnTypes'] array
          All possible types of a MySQL column. In most cases you don't
          need to edit this.
          
   $cfg['AttributeTypes'] array
          Possible attributes for fields. In most cases you don't need to
          edit this.
          
   $cfg['Functions'] array
          A list of functions MySQL supports. In most cases you don't
          need to edit this.

  [1. Server]
  
   [1.1] I'm running php 4+ and my server is crashing each time a
   specific action is required or phpMyAdmin sends a blank page or a page
   full of cryptic characters to my browser, what can I do?
   There are some known php bugs with output buffering and compression.
   Try to set the $cfg['OBGzip'] directive to FALSE in your
   config.inc.php or .php3 file and the zlib.output_compression directive
   to Off in your php configuration file.
   Furthermore, we know about such problems connected to the release
   candidates of php 4.2.0 (tested with php 4.2.0 RC1 to RC4) together
   with MS Internet Explorer. Please upgrade to the release version php
   4.2.0.
   
   [1.2] My Apache server crashes when using phpMyAdmin.
   You should first try the latest versions of Apache (and possibly
   MySQL).
   See also the other FAQ entry about php bugs with output buffering.
   If your server keeps crashing, please ask for help in the various
   Apache support groups.
   
   [1.3] I'm running phpMyAdmin with "cookie" authentication mode under
   PHP 4.2.0 or 4.2.1 loaded as an Apache 2+ module but can't enter the
   script: I'm always displayed the login screen.
   This is a known PHP bug (see this bug report) from the official php
   bug database. It means there is and won't be any phpMyAdmin fix
   against it because there is no way to code a fix.
   
   [1.4] Using phpMyAdmin on IIS, I'm displayed the error message: "The
   specified CGI application misbehaved by not returning a complete set
   of HTTP headers...."
   You just forgot to read the install.txt file from the php
   distribution. Have a look at the last message in this bug report from
   the official php bug database.
   
   [1.5] Using phpMyAdmin on IIS, I'm facing crashes and/or many error
   messages with the http or advanced authentication mode.
   This is a known problem with the php ISAPI filter: it's not so stable.
   For some more information and complete testings see the messages
   posted by André B. aka "djdeluxe76" in this thread from the phpWizard
   forum.
   Please use instead the cookie authentication mode.
   
   [1.6] I can't use phpMyAdmin on PWS: nothing is displayed!
   This seems to be a PWS bug. Filippo Simoncini found a workaroud (at
   this time there is no better fix): remove or comment the DOCTYPE
   declarations (2 lines) from the scripts header.inc.php3,
   header_printview.inc.php3, index.php3, left.php3 and
   libraries/common.lib.php3.
   
   [1.7] How can I GZip or Bzip a dump or a CSV export. It seems to not
   work?
   These features are based on the gzencode() and bzcompress() php
   functions to be more independent of the platform (Unix/Windows, Safe
   Mode or not, and so on). So, you must have PHP4 >= 4.0.4 and
   Zlib/Bzip2 support (--with-zlib and --with-bz2).
   We faced php crashes when trying to download a dump with MS Internet
   Explorer when phpMyAdmin is run with a release candidate of php 4.2.0.
   In this case you should switch to the release version of php 4.2.0.
   
   [1.8] I cannot insert a text file in a table, and I get an error about
   safe mode being in effect.
   Your uploaded file is saved by PHP in the "upload dir", as defined in
   php.ini by the variable upload_tmp_dir (usually the system default is
   /tmp).
   We recommend the following setup for Apache servers running in safe
   mode, to enable uploads of files while being reasonably secure:
     * create a separate directory for uploads: mkdir /tmp/php
     * give ownership to the Apache server's user.group: chown
       apache.apache /tmp/php
     * give proper permission: chmod 600 /tmp/php
     * put upload_tmp_dir = /tmp/php in php.ini
     * restart Apache
       
   [1.9] I'm having troubles when uploading files. In general file
   uploads don't work on my system and uploaded files have a
   Content-Type: header in the first line.
   It's not really phpMyAdmin related but RedHat 7.0. You have a RedHat
   7.0 and you updated your php rpm to php-4.0.4pl1-3.i386.rpm, didn't
   you?
   So the problem is that this package has a serious bug that was
   corrected ages ago in php (2001-01-28: see php's bug tracking system
   for more details). The problem is that the bugged package is still
   available though it was corrected (see redhat's bugzilla for more
   details).
   So please download the fixed package (4.0.4pl1-9) and the problem
   should go away.
   And that fixes the \r\n problem with file uploads!
   
   [1.10] I'm having troubles when uploading files with phpMyAdmin
   running on a secure server. My browser is Internet Explorer and I'm
   using the Apache server.
   As suggested by "Rob M" in the phpWizard forum, add this line to your
   httpd.conf:
       SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown
   It seems to clear up many problems between IE and SSL.
   
   [1.11] I get an 'open_basedir restriction' while uploading a file from
   the query box.
   Since version 2.2.4, phpMyAdmin supports servers with open_basedir
   restrictions. Assuming that the restriction allows you to open files
   in the current directory ('.'), all you have to do is create a 'tmp'
   directory under the phpMyAdmin install directory, with permissions 777
   and the same owner as the owner of your phpMyAdmin directory. The
   uploaded files will be moved there, and after execution of your SQL
   commands, removed.
   
   [1.12] I have lost my MySQL root password, what can I do?
   The MySql manual explains how to reset the permissions.
   
   [1.13] I get an error 'No SQL query' when trying to execute a
   bookmark.
   If PHP does not have read/write access to its upload_tmp_dir, it
   cannot access the uploaded query.
   
   [1.14] I get an error 'No SQL query' when trying to submit a query
   from the convenient text area.
   Check the post_max_size directive from your php configuration file and
   try to increase it.
   
   [1.15] I have problems with mysql.user field names.
   In older MySQL versions, the User and Password fields were named user
   and password. Please modify your field names to align with current
   standards.
   
   [1.16] I cannot upload big dump files.
   The first things to check (or ask your host provider to check) are the
   values of upload_max_filesize, memory_limit and post_max_size in the
   php.ini configuration file.
   All of these three settings limit the maximum size of data that can be
   submitted and handled by php. One user also said that post_max_size
   and memory_limit need to be larger than upload_max_filesize.
   
   [1.17] Does phpMyAdmin support MySQL 4?
   MySQL 4 is not yet fully supported by phpMyAdmin.
   Because of MySQL 4's backwards compatibility you can use phpMyAdmin
   for administering MySQL 4 servers, but phpMyAdmin does not yet support
   its new features. Please notice that in this case it is recommended to
   use php >= 4.1 since older versions of php are not compatible to
   MySQL 4.
   Furthermore, several users reported problems with phpMyAdmin related
   to bugs in MySQL 4. MySQL 4 is still an alpha release and should be
   used for test purposes only!
   
   [1.18] I'm running MySQL <= 4.0.1 having lower_case_table_names set to
   1. If I create a new table with a capital letter in its name it is
   changed to lowercase as it should. But if I try to DROP this table
   MySQL is unable to find the corresponding file.
   This is a bug of MySQL <= 4.0.1. Please upgrade to at least
   MySQL 4.0.2 or turn off your lower_case_table_names directive.
   
   [1.19] I can't run the "display relations" feature because the script
   seems not to know the font face I'm using!
   The "FPDF" library we're using for this feature requires some special
   files to use font faces.
   Please refers to the FPDF manual to build these files.
   
   [1.20] I receive the error "cannot load MySQL extension, please check
   PHP Configuration".
   To connect to a MySQL server, PHP needs a set of MySQL functions
   called "MySQL extension". This extension may be part of the PHP server
   (compiled-in), otherwise it needs to be loaded dynamically. Its name
   is probably mysql.so or mysql.dll. phpMyAdmin tried to load the
   extension but failed.
   Usually, the problem is solved by installing a software package called
   "PHP-MySQL" or something similar.
   
   [1.21] I am running the CGI version of PHP under Unix, and I cannot
   login using cookie auth.
   In php.ini, set mysql.max_links higher than 1.
   
   [1.22] I don't see the "Location of text file" field, so I cannot
   upload.
   This is most likely because in php.ini, your file_uploads parameter is
   not set to "on".
   
   [1.23] I'm running MySQL on a Win32 machine. Each time I create a new
   table the table and field names are changed to lowercase!
   This happens because the MySQL directive lower_case_table_names
   defaults to 1 (ON) in the Win32 version of MySQL. You can change this
   behavior by simply changing the directive to 0 (OFF):
   Just edit you my.ini file that should be located in your Windows
   directory and add the following line:
   lower-case-table-names=0
   Next, save the file and restart the MySQL service. You can always
   check the value of this directive using the query
   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'lower_case_table_names';
   
   [1.24] Some characters are being truncated in my queries, or I get
   characters randomly added. I am running PHP 4.2.3.
   This is a PHP 4.2.3 bug.
   
  [2. Configuration]
  
   [2.1] The error message "Warning: Cannot add header information -
   headers already sent by ..." is displayed, what's the problem?
   Edit your config.inc.php or .php3 file and ensure there is nothing (ie
   no blank lines, no spaces, no characters...) neither before the <?php
   tag at the beginning, neither after the ?> tag at the end.
   
   [2.2] phpMyAdmin can't connect to MySQL. What's wrong?
   Either there is an error with your PHP setup or your username/password
   is wrong. Try to make a small script which uses mysql_connect and see
   if it works. If it doesn't, it may be you haven't even compiled MySQL
   support into PHP.
   
   [2.3] The error message "Warning: MySQL Connection Failed: Can't
   connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock'
   (111)..." is displayed. What can I do?
   For RedHat users, Harald Legner suggests this on the mailing list:
   On my RedHat-Box the socket of mysql is /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock. In
   your php.ini you will find a line
       mysql.default_socket = /tmp/mysql.sock
   change it to
       mysql.default_socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
   Then restart apache and it will work.
   Here is a fix suggested by Brad Ummer in the phpwizard forum:
     * First, you need to determine what socket is being used by MySQL.
       To do this, telnet to your server and go to the MySQL bin
       directory. In this directory there should be a file named
       mysqladmin. Type ./mysqladmin variables, and this should give you
       a bunch of info about your MySQL server, including the socket
       (/tmp/mysql.sock, for example).
     * Then, you need to tell PHP to use this socket.
       Assuming you are using PHP 3.0.10 or better, you can specify the
       socket to use when you open the connection. To do this in
       phpMyAdmin, you need to complete the socket information in the
       config.inc.php3.
       For example: $cfg['Servers'][$i]['socket'] = '/tmp/mysql.sock';
       
   Have also a look at the corresponding section of the MySQL
   documentation.
   
   [2.4] Nothing is displayed by my browser when I try to run phpMyAdmin,
   what can I do?
   Try to set the $cfg['OBGZip'] directive to FALSE in the phpMyAdmin
   configuration file. It helps sometime.
   Also have a look at your php version number: if it contains "4.0b..."
   it means you're running a beta version of PHP. That's not a so good
   idea, please upgrade to a plain revision.
   
   [2.5] Each time I want to insert or change a record or drop a database
   or a table, an error 404 (page not found) is displayed or, with http
   or cookie authentication, I'm asked to login again. What's wrong?
   Check the value you set for the $cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] directive in
   the phpMyAdmin configuration file.
   
  [3. Known limitations]
  
   [3.1] When using http authentication, an user who logged out can not
   relog in with the same nick.
   This is related to the authentication mechanism (protocol) used by
   phpMyAdmin. We plan to change it as soon as we may find enough free
   time to do it, but you can bypass this problem: just close all the
   opened browser windows and then go back to phpMyAdmin. You should be
   able to logs in again.
   
   [3.2] When dumping a large table in compressed mode, I get a memory
   limit error or a time limit error.
   As of version 2.2.4, we build the compressed dump in memory, so large
   tables dumps may hang. The only alternative we can think about (using
   system calls to mysqldump then gzip or bzip2) would not be applicable
   in environments where PHP is in safe mode: access to system programs
   is is limited by the system administrator, and time limit is enforced.
   
   [3.3] With InnoDB tables, I lose foreign key relationships when I
   rename or alter a table.
   This seems to be a InnoDB bug (fixed in MySQL 3.23.50?). However, keep
   in mind that phpMyAdmin as of version 2.3.0 does not support InnoDB.
   
  [4. ISPs, multi-user installations ]
  
   [4.1] I'm an ISP. Can I setup one central copy of phpMyAdmin or do I
   need to install it for each customer?
   Since version 2.0.3, you can setup a central copy of phpMyAdmin for
   all your users. The development of this feature was kindly sponsored
   by NetCologne GmbH. This requires a properly setup MySQL user
   management and phpMyAdmin http or cookie authentication. See the
   install section on "Using http authentication".
   
   [4.2] What's the preferred way of making phpMyAdmin secure against
   evil access?
   This depends on your system.
   If you're running a server which cannot be accessed by other people,
   it's sufficient to use the directory protection bundled with your
   webserver (with Apache you can use .htaccess files, for example).
   If other people have telnet access to your server, you should use
   phpMyAdmin's http authentication feature.
   Suggestions:
     * Your config.inc.php3 file should be chmod 660.
     * All your phpMyAdmin files should be chown phpmy.apache, where
       phpmy is a user whose password is only known to you, and apache is
       the group under which Apache runs.
     * You should use PHP safe mode, to protect from other users that try
       to include your config.inc.php3 in their scripts.
       
   [4.3] I get errors about not being able to include a file in /lang or
   in /libraries.
   Check php.ini, or ask your sysadmin to check it. The include_path must
   contain "." somewhere in it, and open_basedir, if used, must contain
   "." and "./lang" to allow normal operation of phpMyAdmin.
   
   [4.4] phpMyAdmin always gives "Access denied" when using http
   authentication.
   This could happen for several reasons:
     * $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser'] and/or
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass'] are wrong.
     * The username/password you specify in the login-dialog are invalid.
     * You have already setup a security mechanism for the
       phpMyAdmin-directory, eg. a .htaccess file. This would interfere
       with phpMyAdmin's authentication, so remove it.
       
   [4.5] Is it possible to let users create their own databases?
   Starting with 2.2.5, in the user management page, you can enter a
   wildcard database name for a user, and put the privileges you want.
   For example, adding SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP,
   INDEX, ALTER would let a user create/manage his/her database(s).
   
   [4.6] How can I use the Host-based authentication additions?
   If you have existing rules from an old .htaccess file, you can take
   them and add a username between the 'deny'/'allow' and 'from' strings.
   Using the username wildcard of '%' would be a major benefit here if
   your installation is suited to using it. Then you can just add those
   updated lines into the $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules']
   array.
   If you want a pre-made sample, you can try this fragment. It stops the
   'root' user from logging in from any networks other than the private
   network IP blocks.
       //block root from logging in except from the private networks
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['order'] = 'deny,allow';
       $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules'] = array(
           'deny root from all',
           'allow root from localhost',
           'allow root from 10.0.0.0/8',
           'allow root from 192.168.0.0/16',
           'allow root from 172.16.0.0/12',
           );
   
  [5. Browsers or client OS]
  
   [5.1] I get an out of memory error, and my controls are
   non-functional, when trying to create a table with more than 14
   fields.
   We could reproduce this problem only under Win98/98SE. Testing under
   WinNT4 or Win2K, we could easily create more than 60 fields.
   A workaround is to create a smaller number of fields, then come back
   to your table properties and add the other fields.
   
   [5.2] With Xitami 2.5b4, phpMyAdmin won't process form fields.
   This is not a phpMyAdmin problem but a Xitami known bug: you'll face
   it with each script/website that use forms.
   Upgrade or downgrade your Xitami server.
   
   [5.3] I have problems dumping tables with Konqueror (phpMyAdmin 2.2.2)
   With Konqueror 2.1.1: plain dumps, zip and gzip dumps work ok, except
   that the proposed file name for the dump is always 'tbl_dump.php'.
   Bzip2 dumps don't seem to work.
   With Konqueror 2.2.1: plain dumps work; zip dumps are placed into the
   user's temporary directory, so they must be moved before closing
   Konqueror, or else they disappear. Gzip dumps give an error message.
   Testing needs to be done for Konqueror 2.2.2.
   
   [5.4] I can't use the cookie authentication mode because Internet
   Explorer never stores the cookies.
   MS Internet Explorer seems to be really buggy about cookies, at least
   till version 6. And thanks to Andrew Zivolup we've traced also a php
   4.1.1 bug in this area!
   Then, if you're running php 4.1.1, try to upgrade or downgrade... it
   may work!
   
   [5.5] In Internet Explorer 5.0, I get Javascript errors when browsing
   my rows.
   Upgrade to at least Internet Explorer 5.5SP2.
   
   [5.6] In Internet Explorer 5.0, 5.5 or 6.0, I get an error when trying
   to modify a row in a table with many fields, or with a text field.
   Your table neither have a primary key nor an unique one, so we must
   use a long URL to identify this row. There is a limit on the lenght of
   the URL in those browsers, and this not happen in Netscape, for
   example. The workaround is to create a primary or unique key, or use
   another browser.
   
   [5.7] I refresh (reload) my browser, and come back to the welcome
   page.
   Some browsers support right-clicking into the frame you want to
   refresh, just do this in the right frame.
   
   [5.8] With Mozilla 0.9.7 I have problems sending a query modified in
   the query box.
   Looks like a Mozilla bug: 0.9.6 was ok. We will keep an eye on future
   Mozilla versions.
   
   [5.9] With Mozilla 0.9.? to 1.0 and Netscape 7.0-PR1 I can't type a
   whitespace in the SQL-Query edit area: the page scrolls down.
   This is a Mozilla bug (see bug #26882 at Bugzilla).
   
   [5.10] With Netscape 4.75 I get empty rows between each row of data in
   a CSV exported file.
   This is a known Netscape 4.75 bug: it adds some line feeds when
   exporting data in octet-stream mode. Since we can't detect the
   specific Netscape version, we cannot workaround this bug.
   
  [6. Using phpMyAdmin]
  
   [6.1] I can't insert new rows into a table / I can't create a table -
   MySQL brings up a SQL-error.
   Examine the SQL error with care. Often the problem is caused by
   specifying a wrong field-type.
   Common errors include:
     * Using VARCHAR without a size argument
     * Using TEXT or BLOB with a size argument
       
   Also, look at the syntax chapter in the MySQL manual to confirm that
   your syntax is correct.
   
   [6.2] When I create a table, I click the Index checkbox for 2 fields
   and phpMyAdmin generates only one index with those 2 fields.
   In phpMyAdmin 2.2.0 and 2.2.1, this is the way to create a
   multi-fields index. If you want two indexes, create the first one when
   creating the table, save, then display the table properties and click
   the Index link to create the other index.
   
   [6.3] How can I insert a null value into my table?
   Since version 2.2.3, you have a checkbox for each field that can be
   null. Before 2.2.3, you had to enter "null", without the quotes, as
   the field's value.
   
   [6.4] How can I backup my database or table?
   Click on a database or table name in the left frame, the properties
   will be displayed. Then on the menu, click "Export", you can dump the
   structure, the data, or both. This will generate standard SQL
   statements that can be used to recreate your database/table.
   You will need to choose "Save as file", so that phpMyAdmin can
   transmit the resulting dump to your station. Depending on your PHP
   configuration, you will see options to compress the dump. See also the
   $cfg['ExecTimeLimit'] configuration variable.
   For additional help on this subject, look for the word "dump" in this
   document.
   
   [6.5] How can I restore (upload) my database or table using a dump?
   How can I run a ".sql" file?
   Click on a database name in the left frame, the properties will be
   local displayed. Then in the "Run SQL query" section, type in your
   dump filename, or use the Browse button. Then click Go.
   For additional help on this subject, look for the word "upload" in
   this document.
   
   [6.6] How can I use the relation table in Query-by-example?
   Here is an example with the tables persons, towns and countries, all
   located in the database mydb. If you don't have a PMA_relation table,
   create it as explained in the configuration section. Then create the
   example tables:
        CREATE TABLE REL_countries (
          country_code char(1) NOT NULL default '',
          description varchar(10) NOT NULL default '',
          PRIMARY KEY (country_code)
        ) TYPE=MyISAM;
        INSERT INTO REL_countries VALUES ('C', 'Canada');
        CREATE TABLE REL_persons (
          id tinyint(4) NOT NULL auto_increment,
          person_name varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
          town_code varchar(5) default '0',
          country_code char(1) NOT NULL default '',
          PRIMARY KEY (id)
        ) TYPE=MyISAM;
        INSERT INTO REL_persons VALUES (11, 'Marc', 'S', '');
        INSERT INTO REL_persons VALUES (15, 'Paul', 'S', 'C');
        CREATE TABLE REL_towns (
          town_code varchar(5) NOT NULL default '0',
          description varchar(30) NOT NULL default '',
          PRIMARY KEY (town_code)
        ) TYPE=MyISAM;
        INSERT INTO REL_towns VALUES ('S', 'Sherbrooke');
        INSERT INTO REL_towns VALUES ('M', 'Montréal');
        INSERT INTO `PMA_relation` VALUES ('mydb', 'REL_persons',
   'town_code', 'mydb', 'REL_towns', 'town_code');
        INSERT INTO `PMA_relation` VALUES ('mydb', 'REL_persons',
   'country_code', 'mydb', 'REL_countries', 'country_code');
        INSERT INTO `PMA_table_info` VALUES ('mydb', 'REL_towns',
   'description');
        INSERT INTO `PMA_table_info` VALUES ('mydb', 'REL_countries',
   'description');
   Then test like this:
     * Click on your db name in the left frame
     * Choose "Query"
     * Use tables: persons, towns, countries
     * Click "Update query"
     * In the fields row, choose persons.person_name and click the "Show"
       tickbox
     * Do the same for towns.description and countries.descriptions in
       the other 2 columns
     * Click "Update query" and you will see in the query box that the
       correct joins have been generated
     * Click "Submit query"
       
   [6.7] How can I use the "display field" feature?
   Starting from the previous example, create the PMA_table_info as
   explained in the configuration section, then browse your persons
   table, and move the mouse over a town code or country code.
   
   [6.8] How can I produce a PDF schema of my database?
   First you have to fill the "relation", "table_coords" and "pdf_pages"
   configuration variables.
   Then, think about your schema layout: which tables will go on which
   pages.
     * Click on your db name in the left frame
     * Choose "Structure" in the navigation on top
     * Choose "Edit PDF Pages" which should be somewhere at the bottom of
       the page
     * Enter the name for a first pdf page and submit
     * Choose this page to edit
     * Now add a table you want to show on this page and it's coordinates
       and submit
       First you will have to guess this coordinates of course, so just
       expect to have an area of about 297 * 210 and put the tables
       coordinates somewhere in there, you will be able to have a look at
       what happened and change them later.
       For example, x=100 and y=200 means that the table will be at 200
       mm down and 100 mm right from the upper left corner.
       Actually if you have a width of more than 300 or a height of more
       than 200 than it will automatically be scaled but 300*100 is a
       good start to have an idea of what coordinates to use.
     * After every table you submitted you will have the possibility to
       submit more tables
     * When you have entered enough tables Click on your db name in the
       left frame again
     * Now, again at the bottom of the page you should be able to choose
       "Display PDF schema"
       For testing it might be useful to show the grid as well, so you
       can see the coordinates used.
       Maybe also choose color and submit.
     * Save the file he will offer you to something like Schema.pdf
       (Internet Explorer has some bug there which might make it offer it
       without an extension. Under Windows it is important to have the
       extension ".pdf", under other OSes you should be fine just saving
       the file under the name it offers).
       
   [6.9] phpMyAdmin is changing the type of one of my columns!
   No, it's MySQL that is doing silent column type changing.
   
   [6.10] My database has an underscore in it's name, and when I grant
   privileges to a user for this database, a backslash is added before
   the underscore.
   This is normal and means that the grant is done only for this
   database. If there was no backslash, this would be a wildcard grant,
   and the underscore would mean "any character". So, if the database
   name is "john_db", the user would get rights to john1db, john2db...
   instead of just john_db.
   If you really want to grant using a wildcard, there is a dialog box "
   Database (wildcards allowed)" for this.
   
   [6.11] What is the curious symbol ø in the table statistics?
   It means "average".
   
   [6.12] I want to understand some Export options.
   "Complete inserts" adds the column names on every INSERT command, for
   better documentation (but resulting file is bigger).
   "Extended inserts" provides a shorter dump file by using only once the
   INSERT verb and the table name.
   "Enclose table and field names with backquotes" ensures that field and
   table names formed with special characters are protected.
   
   [6.13] I would like to create a database with a dot in its name.
   This is a bad idea, because in MySQL the syntax "database.table" is
   the normal way to reference a database and table name. Worse, MySQL
   will usually let you create a database with a dot, but then you cannot
   work with it, nor delete it.
   
   [6.14] How do I set up the SQL validator?
   To use it, you need a very recent version of PHP, built with Overload,
   XML and PEAR support. On your system command line, run "pear install
   Mail_Mime Net_DIME SOAP" to get the nessecary PEAR modules for usage.
   If you use it, you should be aware that any SQL statement you submit
   will be stored anonymously (database/table/column names, strings,
   numbers replaced with generic values). The Mimer SQL Validator itself,
   is © 2001 Upright Database Technology. We utilize it as free XML-SOAP
   service.
   The overload module is crucial to the functionality of the validator
   service.
   
   [6.15] I want to add a BLOB field and put an index on it, but MySQL
   says "BLOB column '...' used in key specification without a key
   length".
   The right way to do this, is to create the field without any indexes,
   then display the table structure and use the "Create an index" dialog.
   On this page, you will be able to choose your BLOB field, and set a
   size to the index, which is the condition to create an index on a BLOB
   field.
   
  [7. phpMyAdmin project]
  
   [7.1] I have found a bug. How do I inform developers?
   Our Bug Tracker is located at
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/ under the Bugs section.
   But please first discuss your bug with other users:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/ (and choose Forums)
   
   [7.2] I want to translate the messages to a new language or upgrade an
   existing language, where do I start?
   Always use the current cvs version of your language file. For a new
   language, start from english-iso-8859-1.inc.php3. If you don't know
   how to get the cvs version, please ask one of the developers.
   Please note that we try not to use html entities like &eacute; in the
   translations, since we define the right character set in the file.
   With html entities, the text on buttons would not display correctly.
   You can then put your translations, as a zip file to avoid losing
   special characters, on the sourceforge.net translation tracker.
   It would be a good idea to subscribe to the phpmyadmin-translators
   mailing list, because this is where we ask for translations of new
   messages.
   
   [7.3] I would like to help out with the development of phpMyAdmin. How
   should I proceed?
   The following method is preferred for new developers:
     * fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:
       cvs
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin login
       [Password: simply press the Enter key]
       cvs -z3
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin checkout phpMyAdmin
       [This will create a new sub-directory named phpMyAdmin]
     * add your stuff
     * put the modified files (tar'ed and gzip'ed) inside the patch
       tracker of the phpMyAdmin SourceForge account.
       
   Write access to the CVS tree is granted only to experienced developers
   who have already contributed something useful to phpMyAdmin.
   Also, have a look at the Developers section.

Developers Information

   phpMyAdmin is Open Source, so you're invited to contribute to it. Many
   great features have been written by other people and you too can help
   to make phpMyAdmin a useful tool.
   
   If you're planning to contribute source, please read the following
   information:
     * All files include header.inc.php3 (layout),
       libraries/common.lib.php3 (common functions) and config.inc.php3.
       All configuration data belongs in config.inc.php3. Please keep it
       free from other code.
       Commonly used functions should be added to
       libraries/common.lib.php3 and more specific ones may be added
       within a library stored into the libraries sub-directory.
     * Obviously, you're free to use whatever coding style you want. But
       please try to keep your code as simple as possible: beginners are
       using phpMyAdmin as an example application.
       As far as possible, we want the scripts to be XHTML1.0 and CSS2
       compliant on one hand, they fit PEAR coding standards on the other
       hand. Please pay attention to this.
     * Please try to keep up the file-naming conventions. Table-related
       stuff goes to tbl_*.php3, db-related code to db_*.php3 and so on.
     * Please don't use verbose strings in your code, instead add the
       string (at least) to english-iso-8859-1.inc.php3 and print() it
       out.
     * If you want to be really helpful, write an entry for the
       ChangeLog.
       
   IMPORTANT: With 1.4.1, development has switched to CVS. The following
   method is preferred for new developers:
     * fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:
       cvs
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin login
       [Password: simply press the Enter key]
       cvs -z3
       -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmy
       admin checkout phpMyAdmin
       [This will create a new sub-directory named phpMyAdmin]
     * add your stuff
     * put the modified files (tar'ed and gzip'ed) inside the patch
       tracker of the phpMyAdmin SourceForge account
       (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/)
       
   Write access to the CVS tree is granted only to developers who have
   already contributed something useful to phpMyAdmin. If you're
   interested in that, please contact us using the phpmyadmin-devel
   mailing list.

Original Credits of Version 2.1.0
---------------------------------

    This work is based on Peter Kuppelwieser's MySQL-Webadmin. It was his idea
    to create a web-based interface to MySQL using PHP3. Although I have not
    used any of his source-code, there are some concepts I've borrowed from
    him. phpMyAdmin was created because Peter told me he wasn't going to
    further develop his (great) tool.
    Thanks go to
    - Amalesh Kempf <ak-lsml_at_living-source.com> who contributed the
      code for the check when dropping a table or database. He also suggested
      that you should be able to specify the primary key on tbl_create.php3. To
      version 1.1.1 he contributed the ldi_*.php3-set (Import text-files) as
      well as a bug-report. Plus many smaller improvements.
    - Jan Legenhausen <jan_at_nrw.net>: He made many of the changes that
      were introduced in 1.3.0 (including quite significant ones like the
      authentication). For 1.4.1 he enhanced the table-dump feature. Plus
      bug-fixes and help.
    - Marc Delisle <DelislMa_at_CollegeSherbrooke.qc.ca> made phpMyAdmin
      language-independent by outsourcing the strings to a separate file. He
      also contributed the French translation.
    - Alexandr Bravo <abravo_at_hq.admiral.ru> who contributed
      tbl_select.php3, a feature to display only some fields from a table.
    - Chris Jackson <chrisj_at_ctel.net> added support for MySQL
      functions in tbl_change.php3. He also added the
      "Query by Example" feature in 2.0.
    - Dave Walton <walton_at_nordicdms.com> added support for multiple
      servers and is a regular contributor for bug-fixes.
    - Gabriel Ash <ga244_at_is8.nyu.edu> contributed the random access
      features for 2.0.6.
    The following people have contributed minor changes, enhancements, bugfixes
    or support for a new language:
    Jim Kraai, Jordi Bruguera, Miquel Obrador, Geert Lund, Thomas Kleemann,
    Alexander Leidinger, Kiko Albiol, Daniel C. Chao, Pavel Piankov,
    Sascha Kettler, Joe Pruett, Renato Lins, Mark Kronsbein, Jannis Hermanns,
    G. Wieggers.

    And thanks to everyone else who sent me email with suggestions, bug-reports
    and or just some feedback.
