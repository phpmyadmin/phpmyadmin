Original Credits of Version 2.1.0
---------------------------------

    This work is based on Peter Kuppelwieser's MySQL-Webadmin. It was his idea
    to create a web-based interface to MySQL using PHP3. Although I have not
    used any of his source-code, there are some concepts I've borrowed from
    him. phpMyAdmin was created because Peter told me he wasn't going to further
    develop his (great) tool.
    Thanks go to
    - Amalesh Kempf <ak-lsml@living-source.com> who contributed the code for  
      the check when dropping a table or database. He also suggested that you 
      should be able to specify the primary key on tbl_create.php3. To version
      1.1.1 he contributed the ldi_*.php3-set (Import text-files) as well as
      a bug-report. Plus many smaller improvements.
    - Jan Legenhausen <jan@nrw.net>: He made many of the changes that were
      introduced in 1.3.0 (including quite significant ones like the
      authentification). For 1.4.1 he enhanced the table-dump feature. Plus
      bug-fixes and help.
    - Marc Delisle <DelislMa@CollegeSherbrooke.qc.ca> made phpMyAdmin language-
      independent by outsourcing the strings to a separate file. He also
      contributed the French translation.
    - Alexandr Bravo <abravo@hq.admiral.ru> who contributed tbl_select.php3,
      a feature to display only some fields from a table.
    - Chris Jackson <chrisj@ctel.net> added support for MySQL functions in 
      tbl_change.php3. He also added the "Query by Example" feature in 2.0.
    - Dave Walton <walton@nordicdms.com> added support for multiple servers and
      is a regular contributor for bug-fixes.
    - Gabriel Ash <ga244@is8.nyu.edu> contributed the random access features
      for 2.0.6.
    The following people have contributed minor changes, enhancements, bugfixes
    or support for a new language:
    Jim Kraai, Jordi Bruguera, Miquel Obrador, Geert Lund, Thomas Kleemann, Alexander Leidinger,
    Kiko Albiol, Daniel C. Chao, Pavel Piankov, Sascha Kettler, Joe Pruett,
    Renato Lins, Mark Kronsbein, Jannis Hermanns, G. Wieggers.

    And thanks to everyone else who sent me email with suggestions, bug-reports and
    or just some feedback.
