# phpMyAdmin Advisory rules file
#
# Use only UNIX style newlines
#
# This file is being parsed by Advisor.class.php, which should handle syntax
# errors correctly. However, PHP Warnings and the like are being consumed by
# the phpMyAdmin error handler, so those won't show up E.g.: Justification line
# is empty because you used an unescape percent sign, sprintf() returns an
# empty string and no warning/error is shown
#
# Rule Syntax:
# 'rule' identifier[the name of the rule] eexpr [an optional precondition]
#	expr		[variable or value calculation used for the test]
#	expr		[test, if evaluted to 'true' it fires the rule. Use 'value' to insert the calculated value (without quotes)]
#	string		[the issue (what is the problem?)]
#	string		[the recommendation (how do i fix it?)]
#	formatted-string '|' comma-seperated-expr		[the justification  (result of the calculated value / why did this rule fire?)]

# comma-seperated-expr: expr(,expr)*
# eexpr: [expr]		- expr enclosed in []
# expr: a php code literal with extras:
#       - variable names are replaced with their respective values
#       - fired('name of rule') is replaced with true/false when given rule has
#         been fired. Note however that this is a very simple rules engine.
#         Rules are only checked in sequential order as they are written down
#         here. If given rule has not been checked yet, fired() will always
#         evaluate to false
#       - 'value' is replaced with the calculated value. If it is a string, it
#         will be put within single quotes
#       - other than that you may use any php function, initialized variable or
#         constant
#
# identifier: A string enclosed in single quotes
# string: A quoteless string, may contain HTML. Variable names enclosed in
#         curly braces are replaced with links to directly edit this variable.
#         e.g. {tmp_table_size}
# formatted-string: You may use classic php sprintf() string formatting here,
#                   the arguments must be appended after a trailing pipe (|) as
#                   mentioned in above syntax percent signs (%) are
#                   automatically escaped (%%) in the following cases: When
#                   followed by a space, dot or comma and at the end of the

rule 'Uptime below one day'
	Uptime
	value < 86400
	Uptime is less than 1 day, performance tuning may not be accurate.
	To have more accurate averages it is recommended to let the server run for longer than a day before running this analyzer
	The uptime is only %s | ADVISOR_timespanFormat(Uptime)

rule 'Questions below 1,000'
	Questions
	value < 1000
	Fewer than 1,000 questions have been run against this server. The recommendations may not be accurate.

	Current amount of Questions: %s | Questions

rule 'Percentage of slow queries' [Questions > 0 && !PMA_DRIZZLE]
	Slow_queries / Questions * 100
	value >= 5
	There is a lot of slow queries compared to the overall amount of Queries.
	You might want to increase {long_query_time} or optimize the queries listed in the slow query log
	The slow query rate should be below 5%, your value is %s%. | round(value,2)

rule 'Slow query rate' [Questions > 0]
	(Slow_queries / Questions * 100) / Uptime
	value * 60 * 60 > 1
	There is a high percentage of slow queries compared to the server uptime.
	You might want to increase {long_query_time} or optimize the queries listed in the slow query log
	You have a slow query rate of %s per hour, you should have less than 1% per hour. | ADVISOR_bytime(value,2)

rule 'Long query time' [!PMA_DRIZZLE]
	long_query_time
	value >= 10
	{long_query_time} is set to 10 seconds or more, thus only slow queries that take above 10 seconds are logged.
	It is suggested to set {long_query_time} to a lower value, depending on your environment. Usually a value of 1-5 seconds is suggested.
	long_query_time is currently set to %ds. | value

rule 'Release Series' [!PMA_DRIZZLE]
	version
	substr(value,0,2) <= '5.' && substr(value,2,1) < 1
	The MySQL server version less than 5.1.
	You should upgrade, as MySQL 5.1 has improved performance, and MySQL 5.5 even more so.

	version_comment
	preg_match('/source/i',value)
	Version is compiled from source, not a MySQL official binary.
	If you did not compile from source, you may be using a package modified by a distribution. The MySQL manual only is accurate for official MySQL binaries, not any package distributions (such as RedHat, Debian/Ubuntu etc).

rule 'MySQL Architecture'
	system_memory
	value > 3072*1024 && !preg_match('/64/',version_compile_machine) && !preg_match('/64/',version_compile_os)
	MySQL is not compiled as a 64-bit package.
	Your memory capacity is above 3 GiB (assuming the Server is on localhost), so MySQL might not be able to access all of your memory. You might want to consider installing the 64-bit version of MySQL.

# Query cache

# Lame: 'ON' == 0 is true, so you need to compare 'ON' == '0'
rule 'Query cache disabled' [!PMA_DRIZZLE]
	query_cache_size
	value == 0 || query_cache_type == 'OFF' || query_cache_type == '0'
	The query cache is not enabled.
	The query cache is known to greatly improve performance if configured correctly. Enable it by setting {query_cache_size} to a 2 digit MiB value and setting {query_cache_type} to 'ON'. <b>Note:</b> If you are using memcached, ignore this recommendation.
	query_cache_size is set to 0 or query_cache_type is set to 'OFF'

rule 'Query caching method' [!fired('Query cache disabled')]
	Questions / Uptime
	value > 100
	Suboptimal caching method.
	You are using the MySQL Query cache with a fairly high traffic database. It might be worth considering to use <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/ha-memcached.html">memcached</a> instead of the MySQL Query cache, especially if you have multiple slaves.
	The query cache is enabled and the server receives %d queries per second. This rule fires if there is more than 100 queries per second. | round(value,1)

rule 'Query cache efficiency (%)' [!PMA_DRIZZLE && Com_select + Qcache_hits > 0 && !fired('Query cache disabled')]
	Qcache_hits / (Com_select + Qcache_hits) * 100
	value  < 20
	Query cache not running efficiently, it has a low hit rate.
	Consider increasing {query_cache_limit}.
	The current query cache hit rate of %s% is below 20% | round(value,1)

rule 'Query Cache usage' [!fired('Query cache disabled') && !PMA_DRIZZLE]
	100 - Qcache_free_memory / query_cache_size * 100
	value < 80
	Less than 80% of the query cache is being utilized.
	This might be caused by {query_cache_limit} being too low. Flushing the query cache might help as well.
	The current ratio of free query cache memory to total query cache size is %s%. It should be above 80% | round(value,1)

rule 'Query cache fragmentation' [!fired('Query cache disabled') && !PMA_DRIZZLE]
	Qcache_free_blocks / (Qcache_total_blocks / 2) * 100
	value > 20
	The query cache is considerably fragmented.
	Severe fragmentation is likely to (further) increase Qcache_lowmem_prunes. This might be caused by many Query cache low memory prunes due to {query_cache_size} being too small. For a immediate but short lived fix you can flush the query cache (might lock the query cache for a long time). Carefully adjusting {query_cache_min_res_unit} to a lower value might help too, e.g. you can set it to the average size of your queries in the cache using this formula: (query_cache_size - qcache_free_memory) / qcache_queries_in_cache
	The cache is currently fragmented by %s% , with 100% fragmentation meaning that the query cache is an alternating pattern of free and used blocks. This value should be below 20%. | round(value,1)

rule 'Query cache low memory prunes' [!PMA_DRIZZLE && Qcache_inserts > 0 && !fired('Query cache disabled')]
	Qcache_lowmem_prunes / Qcache_inserts * 100
	value > 0.1
	Cached queries are removed due to low query cache memory from the query cache.
	You might want to increase {query_cache_size}, however keep in mind that the overhead of maintaining the cache is likely to increase with its size, so do this in small increments and monitor the results.
	The ratio of removed queries to inserted queries is %s%. The lower this value is, the better (This rules firing limit: 0.1%) | round(value,1)

rule 'Query cache max size' [!fired('Query cache disabled')]
	query_cache_size
	value > 1024 * 1024 * 128
	The query cache size is above 128 MiB. Big query caches may cause significant overhead that is required to maintain the cache.
	Depending on your environment, it might be performance increasing to reduce this value.
	Current query cache size: %s | ADVISOR_formatByteDown(value, 2, 2)

rule 'Query cache min result size' [!fired('Query cache disabled')]
	query_cache_limit
	value == 1024*1024
	The max size of the result set in the query cache is the default of 1 MiB.
	Changing {query_cache_limit} (usually by increasing) may increase efficiency. This variable determines the maximum size a query result may have to be inserted into the query cache. If there are many query results above 1 MiB that are well cacheable (many reads, little writes) then increasing {query_cache_limit} will increase efficiency. Whereas in the case of many query results being above 1 MiB that are not very well cacheable (often invalidated due to table updates) increasing {query_cache_limit} might reduce efficiency.
	query_cache_limit is set to 1 MiB

#
# Sorts
rule 'Percentage of sorts that cause temporary tables' [Sort_scan + Sort_range > 0]
	Sort_merge_passes / (Sort_scan + Sort_range) * 100
	value > 10
	Too many sorts are causing temporary tables.
	Consider increasing {sort_buffer_size} and/or {read_rnd_buffer_size}, depending on your system memory limits
	%s% of all sorts cause temporary tables, this value should be lower than 10%. | round(value,1)

rule 'Rate of sorts that cause temporary tables'
	Sort_merge_passes / Uptime
	value * 60 * 60 > 1
	Too many sorts are causing temporary tables.
	Consider increasing {sort_buffer_size} and/or {read_rnd_buffer_size}, depending on your system memory limits
	Temporary tables average: %s, this value should be less than 1 per hour. | ADVISOR_bytime(value,2)

rule 'Sort rows'
	Sort_rows / Uptime
	value * 60 >= 1
	There are lots of rows being sorted.
	While there is nothing wrong with a high amount of row sorting, you might want to make sure that the queries which require a lot of sorting use indexed columns in the ORDER BY clause, as this will result in much faster sorting
	Sorted rows average: %s | ADVISOR_bytime(value,2)

# Joins, scans
rule 'Rate of joins without indexes'
	(Select_range_check + Select_scan + Select_full_join) / Uptime
	value * 60 * 60 > 1
	There are too many joins without indexes.
	This means that joins are doing full table scans. Adding indexes for the columns being used in the join conditions will greatly speed up table joins
	Table joins average: %s, this value should be less than 1 per hour | ADVISOR_bytime(value,2)

rule 'Rate of reading first index entry'
	Handler_read_first / Uptime
	value * 60 * 60 > 1
	The rate of reading the first index entry is high.
	This usually indicates frequent full index scans. Full index scans are faster than table scans but require lots of CPU cycles in big tables, if those tables that have or had high volumes of UPDATEs and DELETEs, running 'OPTIMIZE TABLE' might reduce the amount of and/or speed up full index scans. Other than that full index scans can only be reduced by rewriting queries.
	Index scans average: %s, this value should be less than 1 per hour | ADVISOR_bytime(value,2)

rule 'Rate of reading fixed position'
	Handler_read_rnd / Uptime
	value * 60 * 60 > 1
	The rate of reading data from a fixed position is high.
	This indicates that many queries need to sort results and/or do a full table scan, including join queries that do not use indexes. Add indexes where applicable.
	Rate of reading fixed position average: %s, this value should be less than 1 per hour | ADVISOR_bytime(value,2)

rule 'Rate of reading next table row'
	Handler_read_rnd_next / Uptime
	value * 60 * 60 > 1
	The rate of reading the next table row is high.
	This indicates that many queries are doing full table scans. Add indexes where applicable.
	Rate of reading next table row: %s, this value should be less than 1 per hour | ADVISOR_bytime(value,2)

# temp tables
rule 'Different tmp_table_size and max_heap_table_size'
	tmp_table_size - max_heap_table_size
	value !=0
	{tmp_table_size} and {max_heap_table_size} are not the same.
	If you have deliberately changed one of either: The server uses the lower value of either to determine the maximum size of in-memory tables. So if you wish to increase the in-memory table limit you will have to increase the other value as well.
	Current values are tmp_table_size: %s, max_heap_table_size: %s | ADVISOR_formatByteDown(tmp_table_size, 2, 2), ADVISOR_formatByteDown(max_heap_table_size, 2, 2)

rule 'Percentage of temp tables on disk' [Created_tmp_tables + Created_tmp_disk_tables > 0]
	Created_tmp_disk_tables / (Created_tmp_tables + Created_tmp_disk_tables) * 100
	value > 25
	Many temporary tables are being written to disk instead of being kept in memory.
	Increasing {max_heap_table_size} and {tmp_table_size} might help. However some temporary tables are always being written to disk, independent of the value of these variables. To eliminate these you will have to rewrite your queries to avoid those conditions (Within a temporary table: Presence of a BLOB or TEXT column or presence of a column bigger than 512 bytes) as mentioned in the beginning of an <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150111255065841&comments">Article by the Pythian Group</a>
	%s% of all temporary tables are being written to disk, this value should be below 25% | round(value,1)

rule 'Temp disk rate' [!fired('Percentage of temp tables on disk')]
	Created_tmp_disk_tables / Uptime
	value * 60 * 60 > 1

#rule 'Temp table rate'
#	Created_tmp_tables / Uptime
#	value * 60 * 60 > 1
#	Many intermediate temporary tables are being created.
#	This may be caused by queries under certain conditions as mentioned in the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/internal-temporary-tables.html">MySQL Documentation</a>. Consider increasing {sort_buffer_size} (sorting), {read_rnd_buffer_size} (random read buffer, ie, post-sort), {read_buffer_size} (sequential scan).

However the bigger this value, the longer the recovery time will be when database crashes, so this value should not be set much higher than 256 MiB. Please note however that you cannot simply change the value of this variable. You need to shutdown the server, remove the InnoDB log files, set the new value in my.cnf, start the server, then check the error logs if everything went fine.

	Your InnoDB log size is at %s% in relation to the InnoDB buffer pool size, it should not be below 20% | round(value,1)

rule 'Max InnoDB log size' [innodb_buffer_pool_size > 0 && innodb_log_file_size / innodb_buffer_pool_size * 100 < 30]
	innodb_log_file_size / (1024 * 1024)
	value > 256
	The InnoDB log file size is inadequately large.
	It is usually sufficient to set {innodb_log_file_size} to 25% of the size of {innodb_buffer_pool_size}. A very big {innodb_log_file_size} slows down the recovery time after a database crash considerably.

	Your absolute InnoDB log size is %s MiB | round(value,1)

rule 'InnoDB buffer pool size' [system_memory > 0]
	innodb_buffer_pool_size / system_memory * 100
	value < 60
	Your InnoDB buffer pool is fairly small.
	The InnoDB buffer pool has a profound impact on performance for InnoDB tables. Assign all your remaining memory to this buffer. For database servers that use solely InnoDB as storage engine and have no other services (e.g. a web server) running, you may set this as high as 80% of your available memory. If that is not the case, you need to carefully assess the memory consumption of your other services and non-InnoDB-Tables and set this variable accordingly. If it is set too high, your system will start swapping, which decreases performance significantly.

	You are currently using %s% of your memory for the InnoDB buffer pool. This rule fires if you are assigning less than 60%, however this might be perfectly adequate for your system if you don't have much InnoDB tables or other services running on the same machine. | value
